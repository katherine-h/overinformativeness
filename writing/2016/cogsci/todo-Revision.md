# CogSci Revision - To-Do list

## Points from reviewers to be addressed:

- There is one significant limitation, raised by reviewers: lack of an
  objective definition (or really, *any* definition) of "basic level".
  Since this is a basic problem with this entire literature, and since
  defining "basic level" is actually a tricky theoretical puzzle, I think
  this flaw should be categorized as "cognitive science is hard" rather
  than "this paper is insufficient." That said, this is one of the factors
  that makes this paper feel incremental, rather than than the major leap
  one would normally expect of a prize-worthy paper.

  --> **Judith** will add a sentence about this -- Judith says: I didn't really have anything inspired to say about this in the little space we have. Leave it as is?

- I wondered whether factors Length and Frequency are correlated.

  --> I assume they are, should we mention it? If yes, where? **Judith -- DONE** 

- Although the paper reports significance of the Helmert contrast
  basic.vs.super, it might be good to back this up by comparing the
  presented model with one that subsumes basic and super under the same
  factor level, taking model complexity into account. My hunch is that the
  simpler model might possibly be preferred despite the significance. If
  that were so, it would basically mean: subjects use basic categories
  unless the referential task forces them to be more specific.

  --> **Judith -- DONE**

- It was not clear to me how the model's posterior predictives in Fig 5
  are to be understood. Are these means or MAPs, or something else? -
  Relatedly, the reported r-values seem to suggest the use of point
  estimates. Which ones?

  --> **Robert -- DONE** 

- The paper says that it does Bayesian model comparison but I think what
  it does should better be called estimation. A nice recent paper that
  shows a clear difference is "Another Statistical Paradox" by Wagenmakers,
  Lee, Rouder and Morey.

  --> **Robert**

- I am not intimately familiar with all of the literature on referring
  expressions, and so I cannot say whether choice of abstraction-level in
  noun categories has not been studied elsewhere before. The paper is not
  entirely clear about this. If this has not been investigated before, this
  is a novel and very relevant empirical contribution. This would be a
  strong argument that this should be accepted.

  --> We do mention the connection to Rosch's results and to the basic level phenomenon. Should we make this connection more clear? Should we make more clear how our approach is different? 

  **Robert, Noah ** what do you think?

  The only other empirical paper I know is Waxman & Hatch (1992), which is a devo paper showing that 4 year olds are more likely to produce superordinate references than 3 year olds... But this is in isolation (rather than incorporating pragmatics). There's also a social psych paper by John, Hampson, & Goldberg (1991) that look at personality-trait hierarchies... But that's a pretty different domain, too. Probably not worth citing these in the cogsci paper, but would be nice for the bigger paper.

  --> Judith will ask Herb if he has any more knowledge of the related lit

  --> For the bigger paper we will do a more thorough lit review, it's questionable if we can fit more into the cogsci paper


## Points interesting for the big paper:

- It would have been great to see a baseline of noun-category choice in
  the absence of a referential task. Just one picture. Maybe multiple
  choice, so that subjects know what counts. Would you call that thing
  "dalmatian", "dog" or "animal"? Would you call that thing "gummy bear",
  "candy" or "food"? This might help getting independent motivation for fixing a particular
  noun as the "basic level". Without one it is hard to assess whether the
  paper really provides an explanation of a preference for basic levels.
  Witness the observed deviance of the "candy" cases.

  --> good idea, maybe next time? Then again, this might bias people (e.g. making it more likely for people to choose the super level in the item33 condition since now they are aware that we care about levels, so they may want to make use of the whole "scale"). 
  Also, isn't the item33 condition somewhat a baseline? This is where speakers are unconstrained with respect to the reference level  

  --> We can think about doing sth like this (showing just one picture, free referencing) to get baselines to incorporate in the big paper


## Points we probably don't need to address:

- I was unclear about the use of the word “condition”. Because we
  normally think of conditions as being something that participants were
  assigned to, the procedure for creating the conditions surprised me. A
  single example would help clarify what the conditions were doing. This is
  the only portion of the paper that I did not understand well enough to
  feel like I could do myself.

  --> How do we make clear (is it really necessary to explain this?) that we are talking about conditions not in the (maybe classical-psychological) sense of the term as experimental conditions that participants are assigned to but instead as different ways the stimuli are presented (to manipulate our independent variable context)?
  Just to make sure I looked up the definition of an experimental condition in the dictionary: An experimental condition is one of the distinct states of affairs or values of the independent variable for which the dependent variable is measured in order to carry out statistical tests or calculations. 
  So, there should be no problem with how we use the term.
  Also, we did call the conditions "context conditions" in the paper... 

- The experiment design and the probabilistic models employed in the paper
  seem solid. My only recommendation is to clarify further the description
  of the mathematical model, as well as some of the symbolism, in order to
  make the work more accessible to a less technical audience, especially
  since the basic problem they deal with is both very fundamental and
  accessible.

  --> No information given on what parts are unclear 

- Given my background, I encourage the authors to study this problem in a
  more general setting. In particular, since name-reference objects form a
  partial order, it would be really interesting to investigate the
  possibility of framing the analysis in a (simple) categorical setting
  (using as tools, for instance, certain properties of Galois connections).
  The reason to try this approach is not purely formal, but, in my opinion,
  could open the way to the study of more complex ways to "point" and refer
  to things.

  --> ok, interesting perspective

- Finally, I believe that it would be interesting to have a comparative
  analysis of this models across different language systems, to see if  any
  major structural differences are observed.

  --> We could point out Gatt et al's experiments in Dutch, but probably not necessary
