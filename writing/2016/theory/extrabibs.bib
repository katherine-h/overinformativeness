annote = {Framing: Is production adapted to comprehension? And if so, why?

In Experiment 1 they answer the first question in the positive. In experiment 2, three different accounts are tested against each other (they conclude their evidence supports 3. I think they were probably testing 1. and 2. against each other and then had to come up with a post hoc story why the evidence didn't turn out as expected):
Production is adapted to comprehension because...
1. "Listener-need" account (Gricean audience design type story)
2. Speaker experience account: production reflects speakers' own comprehension experience
3. Conceptual constraints: parallel processes for comprehension to conceptual structure as for conceptual structure to production

Test case: instrument omission. 
Methodology: production studies in a recall paradigm. Stories with different instruments and context are retold by subjects.

Experiment 1 
Method: 2x2, instrument typicality (typical or not) and importance (for the story - important vs unimportant)
Prediction: Atypical instruments should be mentioned more, important instruments should be mentioned more.
Results: More typical instruments ommitted more. Effect of importance only in 1 category: separate clause after verb.

Experiment 2 
Method: 2x2x2x2: instrument typicality, picture informativeness (informative: showing instrument, uninformative: not showing instrument), did speaker see picture before or after they read the passage, did listener see picture as speaker told story
Prediction: if listener-need account is correct, then typicality effect should disappear if listener gets instrument information from other source (ie sees picture). if speaker-experience account is correct, effect should disappear if speaker gets information from additional source
Results: somewhat more instrument mentions for ignorant hearers (some support for audience design). overall just big main effect of typicality. but also some support for availability-based production: more typical instruments tend to be mentioned BEFORE verb, less typical ones AFTER. this could also be a UID effect. 

Conclusion: They propose a box model with a quantitative component that builds on macro-propositions. There are multiple points of possible interference, that's why the results aren't directly pro audience design or pro speaker-need. They conclude that the default is to not specify instruments and only when necessary, mention them.

Problems: The model is strange. Typical box model stuff, unclear where it all comes from. Methodologically, it's not clear that the items are frequency-matched (they probably aren't), so it's hard to tell whether the effect is really due to typicality or just sth simple like frequency. Of course in this case one might argue that they should be highly co-linear, since we tend to talk more about more frequently occurring things (like knives, rather than ice-picks). However, they found precisely that more typical (and thus supposedly more frequently occurring) instruments are the ones that are ommitted more, so they should be talked about less (in these particular constructions) than less typical objects.

@article{Lockridge2002,
abstract = {A current debate in psycholinguistics concerns how speakers take addressees' knowledge or needs into account during the packaging of utterances. In retelling stories, speakers are more likely to mention atypical instruments than easily inferrable, typical instruments; in a seminal study, Brown and Dell (1987) suggested that this is not an adjustment to addressees but is simply easiest for speakers. They concluded that manipulating addressees' knowledge did not affect speakers' mention of instruments. However, their addressees were confederates who heard the same stories repeatedly. We had speakers retell stories to naive addressees who either saw or did not see a picture illustrating the main action and instrument. When addressees lacked pictures, speakers were more likely to mention atypical instruments, to mention them early (within the same clause as the action verb), and to mark atypical instruments as indefinite. This suggests that with visual copresence, speakers can take addressees' knowledge into account in early syntactic choices.},
