abstract = {In this discussion note, we reply to Bezuidenhout's (2013) claim that the narrow-temporal scale of language processing examined using the Visual World Paradigm makes this methodology unsuitable for studying perspective-taking in conversation. We counter that this paradigm has, and will continue to make, valuable contributions to our understanding of the representation and use of perspective information, as well as to the larger questions about the architecture of the language system. In doing so, we elaborate on the breadth of evidence from the sentence processing literature that supports the claim that perspective information is integrated into the processes of language comprehension and production.{\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},
