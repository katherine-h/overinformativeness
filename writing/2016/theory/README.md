# Over 'overinformativeness': rational redundant referring expressions

### Intro

Referring is one of the most basic and prevalent uses of language, so we're probably pretty good at it. What does `being good at it' mean? Generally, trying to abide by Gricean maxims, including: be as informative as possible but not more informative than necessary. For the past 40 years, researchers have been noticing that speakers don't seem to abide by the second part of that in their production of referring expressions: they often include modifiers that aren't necessary for uniquely determining reference. Similarly, they often choose to refer to an object at a level of abstraction that is more specific than necessary for determining unique reference. 
 
This has posed a challenge for rational accounts of language use (including the Gricean one): what accounts for these deviations from what the simple Gricean picture predicts? Why this extra expenditure of useless effort? Why this seeming blindness to the level of informativeness requirement? Is it just that speakers aren't economical after all? Or is there some utility in being redundant and overly specific? **This paragraph will introduce informativeness, cost, typicality**

Here, we show that introducing noisy truth functions into the semantics of referring expressions can account both for the systematic patterns of overinformativeness in modified referring expressions as well as for speakers' preference to refer at the basic level (and deviations from that preference in certain cases).

#### Review of phenomena to capture in modified REs

1. Color-size asymmetry (Pechmann, Sedivy, Engelhardt, Gatt)

2. Scene variation (Koolen, Katsos & Davies)

3. Typicality effects (Westerbeek, Sedivy, Mitchell)

#### Review of phenomena to capture in nominal REs

1. Basic level preference (Rosch)

2. Rich interactions between informativeness, cost (length/frequency), typicality


### Modeling REs -- failures of basic RSA followed by the one trick to rule them all

1. Basic RSA framework (without cost) and 

	- why it can't capture overmodified REs 
	
2. RSA with cost

	- why it still can't capture overmodified REs

3. RSA with noisy truth functions
	
	- intuition for noisy truth functions (defer discussion of what the fidelity parameters exactly mean and how they come about compositionally to the general discussion)

	- show that this gets qualitative result of overmodification under certain parameter settings in the first place (even assuming equal costs)

	- !! show that it predicts scene variation effects (introduce our notion of scene variation, but also show the qualitative effect under the Koolen definition?)

	- !! bridge: to evaluate the model, we need human data

### Experiment 1: modified referring expressions

	- write down experiment

	- BDA and results

	- discussion:

		1. when modifiers don't work perfectly, adding modmifiers adds utility (ie no "overinformativeness")

		2. is this just about this very specific corner of the production literature? 

### RSA for nominal choice

	- analogous problem (but different costs)

	- typicality effects! baked into semantics via empirical norms

### Experiment 2: nominal choice

	- write down experiment

	- BDA and results	

	- discussion:

		1. we can get basic level preference by taking into account utterance cost (frequency & length, both with non-zero weight!)

		2. it's not just all basic level unless forced to be more specific (3-level Helmert contrasts justified over binary condition variable)

		3. typicality matters (non-zero weight) -- point to one particular example

### RSA with empirical typicality for modified REs

	- add typicality effects as in nominal choice model: made up noise terms (banana table) captures sedivy/westerbeek effect

	- emprical elicitation of color typicalities for each color-noun combination: non-zero type weight in interpolation analysis suggests typicality is necessary even in our dataset that explicitly tried to minimize it (pull out golfball example)		

### General discussion

	- big open problem: compositionality for typicality effects

	- SEE TEX FILE FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION POINTS

### Appendix

#### Replication of Gatt et al 2011 

	- results: overall lower overmodification rates
	
	- discussion: we used realistic, ie. more typical, colors, which are known to drive down overmodification
