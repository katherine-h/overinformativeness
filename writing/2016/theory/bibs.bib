abstract = {When people in conversation refer repeatedly to the same object, they come to use the same terms. This phenomenon, called lexical entrainment, has several possible explanations. Ahistorical accounts appeal only to the informativeness and availability of terms and to the current salience of the object's features. Historical accounts appeal in addition to the recency and frequency of past references and to partner-specific conceptualizations of the object that people achieve interactively. Evidence from 3 experiments favors a historical account and suggests that when speakers refer to an object, they are proposing a conceptualization of it, a proposal their addresses may or may not agree to. Once they do establish a shared conceptualization, a conceptual pact, they appeal to it in later references even when they could use simpler references. Over time, speakers simplify conceptual pacts and, when necessary, abandon them for new conceptualizations.},

abstract = {Is language understanding a special case of social cognition? To help evaluate this view, we can formalize it as the rational speech-act theory: Listeners assume that speakers choose their utterances approximately optimally, and listeners interpret an utterance by using Bayesian inference to "invert" this model of the speaker. We apply this framework to model scalar implicature ("some" implies "not all," and "N" implies "not more than N"). This model predicts an interaction between the speaker's knowledge state and the listener's interpretation. We test these predictions in two experiments and find good fit between model predictions and human judgments.},
annote = {on this one and Frank {\&}amp; Goodman 2012:

These papers are part of a more general push towards developing probabilistic models of pragmatic inference. The big ones have come from Amsterdam/Berlin/Tubingen (game-theoretic models that treat communicative settings as signaling games, rely on Bayesian update and iterated reasoning), the MIT/Stanford crowd around Mike Frank and Noah Goodman (Bayesian models that assume the listener has model of informative speaker), and more recently Ben Russell's thesis, where he derives implicatures probabilistically from a pretty complex theory of utterance interpretation.

Gricean Quantity reasoning:
1. The speaker could have produced the stronger alternative, which would have also been RELEVANT and more INFORMATIVE. 
2. If the speaker KNEW that the stronger alternative holds, she would have used the stronger alternative
3. The speaker is well-informed and HONEST
4. Thus the stronger alternative must not hold

Commonalities:
- pragmatic inference as social cognition: what other things could the speaker have said/done given what he knows
- assume that listeners have a model of the speaker, which in turn is assumed to be maximally informative given the literal meaning of utterances
- listeners then choose actions (interpretations) in proportion to the probability with which the speaker would have produced a particular utterance in a particular situation


Differences:
- 2012: referential expressions; assume full speaker access
- 2013: quantified statements; model limited access situations

What are the conditions that govern conversation? (In reaction to pure formalists.)

- distinction between what is said (sentence meaning) vs what is meant (speaker meaning) 
- hierarchy of meaning (total signification of an utterance, said/meant, implicated -{\&}gt; conventionally/conversationally, conversational implicature-{\&}gt; genearlized/particularized)

- conventional: consequence of expression's conventional meaning, not guided by rational principles of language use. not part of the truth conditions.

- conversational: arising from the cooperative principle. mutual assumption of rationality. different maxims guide different aspects of utterance choice:
- information conveyed: Quantity, Quality, Relevance
- form of information conveyed: Manner

- different ways to disobey maxims:
- violation. bad gricean behavior.
- opting out. make clear that your further behavior cannot be considered fully gricean.
- clash...
- flouting. get implicature by exploiting maxims. 

- GCI-PCI
- GCI: implicature arises unless blocked by context
- PCI: implicature arises in virtue of special fetaures of the context

- examples of different maxims:
- Quantity: south of france; good party? some friends.; letter of recommendation; indefinites
- Quality: irony, metaphor, meiosis, hyperbole
- Relevance: skiing example-{\&}gt; yes/no
- Manner: c-h-o-c-o-l-a-t-e, and

- features of conversational implicature: non-conventionality, calculability, non-detachability, cancelability, reinforceability (levinson), universality (levinson)

abstract = {Speakers often overspecify their target descriptions and include more information than necessary for unique identification of the target referent. In the current paper, we study the production of definite target descriptions, and explore several factors that might influence the amount of information that is included in these descriptions. First, we present the results of a large-scale experiment investigating referential overspecification as a function of the properties of a target referent and the communicative setting. The results show that speakers (both in written and oral conditions) tend to provide more information when a target is plural rather than singular, and in domains where the speaker has more referential possibilities to describe the target. However, written and spoken referring expressions do not differ in terms of semantic redundancy. We conclude our paper by discussing the implications of our empirical findings for pragmatic theory and for language production models. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This study investigates to what extent the amount of variation in a visual scene causes speakers to mention the attribute color in their definite target descriptions, focusing on scenes in which this attribute is not needed for identification of the target. The results of our three experiments show that speakers are more likely to redundantly include a color attribute when the scene variation is high as compared with when this variation is low (even if this leads to overspecified descriptions). We argue that these findings are problematic for existing algorithms that aim to automatically generate psychologically realistic target descriptions, such as the Incremental Algorithm, as these algorithms make use of a fixed preference order per domain and do not take visual scene variation into account.},

abstract = {Speech is often produced incrementally: Speakers start to articulate an utterance before knowing exactly what they are going to say. The time devoted to articulating first parts of an utterance is simultaneously used to process further information which is to be incorporated into that utterance. Empirical evidence is presented which supports the assumption that referential noun phrases are indeed often produced incrementally. This assumption explains several phenomena: first, speakers' production of overspecified ('redundant' utterances; second, irregularities concerning the ordering of prenominal adjectives; and third, the way acoustic stress is assigneed in referential noun phrases.},

abstract = {Characterizing the relationship between form-based linguistic knowledge and representation of context has long been of importance in the study of on-line language processing. Recent experimental research has shown evidence of very rapid effects of referential context in resolving local indeterminacies on-line. However, there has been no consensus regarding the nature of these context effects. The current paper summarizes recent work covering a range of phenomena for which referential contrast has been shown to influence on-line processing, including prenominal and post-nominal modification, focus operators, and intonational focus. The results of the body of work suggest that referential context effects are not limited to situations in which the linguistic form of the utterance directly specifies the point of contact with context. Rather, context effects of a pragmatic, Gricean nature appear to be possible, suggesting the relationship between linguistic form and context in rapid on-line processing can be of a very indirect nature.},

abstract = {A substantial amount of recent work in natural language generation has focused on the generation of ''one-shot'' referring expressions whose only aim is to identify a target referent. Dale and Reiter's Incremental Algorithm (IA) is often thought to be the best algorithm for maximizing the similarity to referring expressions produced by people. We test this hypothesis by eliciting referring expressions from human subjects and computing the similarity between the expressions elicited and the ones generated by algorithms. It turns out that the success of the IA depends substantially on the ''preference order'' (PO) employed by the IA, particularly in complex domains. While some POs cause the IA to produce referring expressions that are very similar to expressions produced by human subjects, others cause the IA to perform worse than its main competitors; moreover, it turns out to be difficult to predict the success of a PO on the basis of existing psycholinguistic findings or frequencies in corpora. We also examine the computational complexity of the algorithms in question and argue that there are no compelling reasons for preferring the IA over some of its main competitors on these grounds. We conclude that future research on the generation of referring expressions should explore alternatives to the IA, focusing on algorithms, inspired by the Greedy Algorithm, which do not work with a fixed PO.},
