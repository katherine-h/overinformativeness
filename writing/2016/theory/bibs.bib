abstract = {This paper presents problems for Stalnaker’s common ground theory of presupposition. Stalnaker (Linguist and Philos 25:701–721, 2002) proposes a 2-stage process of utterance interpretation: presupposed content is added to the common ground prior to acceptance/rejection of the utterance as a whole. But this revision makes presupposition difficult to distinguish from assertion. A more fundamental problem is that the common ground theory rests on a faulty theory of assertion—that the essence of assertion is to present the content of an utterance as new information. Many examples are presented of utterances which are felicitous but not informative in this way.},

abstract = {Ventriloquism is the ancient art of making one's voice appear to come from elsewhere, an art exploited by the Greek and Roman oracles, and possibly earlier. We regularly experience the effect when watching television and movies, where the voices seem to emanate from the actors' lips rather than from the actual sound source. Originally, ventriloquism was explained by performers projecting sound to their puppets by special techniques, but more recently it is assumed that ventriloquism results from vision "capturing" sound. In this study we investigate spatial localization of audio-visual stimuli. When visual localization is good, vision does indeed dominate and capture sound. However, for severely blurred visual stimuli (that are poorly localized), the reverse holds: sound captures vision. For less blurred stimuli, neither sense dominates and perception follows the mean position. Precision of bimodal localization is usually better than either the visual or the auditory unimodal presentation. All the results are well explained not by one sense capturing the other, but by a simple model of optimal combination of visual and auditory information.},

abstract = {The delay between the signal to move the eyes, and the execution of the corresponding eye movement, is variable, and skewed; with an early peak followed by a considerable tail. This skewed distribution renders the answer to the question "What is the delay between language input and saccade execution?" problematic; for a given task, there is no single number, only a distribution of numbers. Here, two previously published studies are reanalysed, whose designs enable us to answer, instead, the question: How long does it take, as the language unfolds, for the oculomotor system to demonstrate sensitivity to the distinction between "signal" (eye movements due to the unfolding language) and "noise" (eye movements due to extraneous factors)? In two studies, participants heard either 'the man{\ldots}' or 'the girl{\ldots}', and the distribution of launch times towards the concurrently, or previously, depicted man in response to these two inputs was calculated. In both cases, the earliest discrimination between signal and noise occurred at around 100ms. This rapid interplay between language and oculomotor control is most likely due to cancellation of about-to-be executed saccades towards objects (or their episodic trace) that mismatch the earliest phonological moments of the unfolding word.},

When we hear the proverb `Time flies like an arrow' we might ponder its meaning, but not the fact that there are almost 100 grammatically permissible interpretations of this short sentence. On occasion, however, we do notice sentential ambiguity: headlines, such as `Two Sisters Reunited After 18 Years in Checkout Counter', are amusing because they so consistently lead to the unintended interpretation (presumably, the sisters did not spend 18 years at the checkout). It is this consistent preference for one interpretation-and one grammatical structure-rather than another that has fuelled research into sentence processing for more than 20 years. Until relatively recently, the dominant belief had been that these preferences arise from general principles that underlie our use of grammar, with certain grammatical constructions being preferred over others. There has now accrued, however, a considerable body of evidence demonstrating that these preferences are not absolute, but can change in particular circumstances. With this evidence have come new theories of sentence processing, some of which, at first glance, radically question the standard notions of linguistic representation, grammar and understanding.},

abstract = {Participants' eye movements were recorded as they inspected a semi-realistic visual scene showing a boy, a cake, and various distractor objects. Whilst viewing this scene, they heard sentences such as 'the boy will move the cake' or 'the boy will eat the cake'. The cake was the only edible object portrayed in the scene. In each of two experiments, the onset of saccadic eye movements to the target object (the cake) was significantly later in the move condition than in the eat condition; saccades to the target were launched after the onset of the spoken word cake in the move condition, but before its onset in the eat condition. The results suggest that information at the verb can be used to restrict the domain within the context to which subsequent reference will be made by the (as yet unencountered) post-verbal grammatical object. The data support a hypothesis in which sentence processing is driven by the predictive relationships between verbs, their syntactic arguments, and the real-world contexts in which they occur.},

annote = {- review of research on production of referential expressions (focus on pronouns vs names {\&}amp; relative acoustic prominence). framed as an audience design issue, for which she cites a bunch of support, but also points to limits.

- CHOICES in referring - pronouns vs more {\&}quot;explicit{\&}quot; forms of reference, more or less acoustic prominence
--{\&}gt; (why explicit i don't know)


- what level to make assumptions about addresse knowledge at? specific vs generic addressees

- local vs global assumptions about addressee
- global: shared personal experience, community membership; only to be determined once for a single addressee/situation
- local: what does addressee know/ what is he attending to at each point in discourse. dynamic
--{\&}gt; but can't the global assumptions also be updated dynamically? like when you misremember whether you've told your addressee a particular piece of information and he signals as such with feedback?

- for the rest of paper focuses only on local factors affecting reference production: see paper notes

- centering theory, backward-looking center as most focused. driven by syntactic prominence

- different ways of modeling accessibility of referents in discourse:
- activation of representation (arnold 1998); competition for activation (gradient)
- Centering Theory (grosz et al 1995); relative accessibility based only on grammatical function. does not capture relative differences in activation

- how to ditinguish addressee and speaker-based processes? if speaker's knowledge reflects hearer's knowledge closely enough, you can't tease the two apart

- the Expectancy hypothesis as an explanation for why such diverse factors affect accessibility: they are all correlated with the likelihood of sth being mentioned again. if people use this information, it contributes to ease of comprehension. efficient.

- speaker-oriented vs addressee-oriented view:
- support for speaker-o. view (availability-based production):
- ferreira {\&}amp; dell 2000: speakers place accessible elements early even when this results in local ambiguities

- support for addressee-o. view:

- evidence for AD
- attenuated expressions (pronouns, deaccented forms) used when referent is assumed to be in focus of attention of the hearer (brennan 1995, chafe 1976 2004; gundel et al 1993, prince 1981, geosz{\&}amp; sidner 1986, grosz et al 1995)
- when ref. expression potentially ambiguous, more use of gendered pronouns
- speakers use word pronounciations modulated based on their own and their intelocutor's social identity
- speakers use prosody that disambiguates syntactic structures
- lockridge {\&}amp; brennan, haywood et al 2005
- new yorkers describe landmarks differently when talking to a fellow new yorker than to a visitor (isaacs {\&}amp; clark 1987)
- descriptions of famous people contain more infoermation when referring to people assumed to be less identifiable based on shared communicty membership fussell {\&}amp; krauss 1992)
- the more experience a speaker has with an addressee, the more attenuated ref expressions (previously used) become (tangram study, clark {\&}amp; wilkeds-gibbs 1986)
- people continue to use terms established in conceptual pacts even when that term is too specific/overinformative (brennan {\&}amp; clark 1996), but are more likely to abandon term when talking to new addressee

- evidence against AD
- no systematic avoidance of syntactic ambiguity with word order or {\&}quot;that{\&}quot; omission
- speakers use prosody that disambiguates syntactic structures even when unnecessary
- decisions to mention instruments independent of speaker's beliefs about addressee knowledge
- estimates of referent identifiability often biased in direction of speaker's own knowledge of famous names},

Yet speakers are often disfluent, for example, saying "thee, uh, candle" instead of "the candle." By monitoring listeners' eye movements to objects in a display, we demonstrated that the fluency of an article ("thee uh" vs. "the") affects how listeners interpret the following noun. With a fluent article, listeners were biased toward an object that had been mentioned previously, but with a disfluent article, they were biased toward an object that had not been mentioned. These biases were apparent as early as lexical information became available, showing that disfluency affects the basic processes of decoding linguistic input.},

A clear limit in the accuracy of numerosity judgements was found to be set at 4 for regularly spaced elements with spatial frequencies below approximately 10 cycles/deg (element and interelement interval of 0-05 deg). This limit in terms of accuracy is accompanied by a fast and almost constant response time for arrays of 4 or less, compared to response times for arrays of more than 4 elements. The limit in accuracy falls to 2 elements rather than 4 for spacing narrower than 0-05 deg alghough with such spacing the elements are still easily resolved. The limit of 4 is found if the stimulus is a bright afterimage, lasting for approximately 60 s. This result suggests that the limit is independent of the time allowed for a single fixation and is a perceptual limit rather than a limit in some memory buffer.

This result, which is not explained by more recent demographic history, local language diversity, or statistical non-independence within language families, points to parallel mechanisms shaping genetic and linguistic diversity and supports an African origin of modern human languages.},

annote = {From Duplicate 2 ( Language redundancy predicts syllabic duration and the spectral characteristics of vocalic syllable nuclei - Aylett, Matthew; Turk, Alice )

- building on strong inverse relationship between predictability and syllable duration they test relationship between predictability and spectral characteristics (first two formants, centralization). they find similar effects, but with effects dependent on particular vowels. explain in terms of smooth signal redundancy hypothesis

- they trace their work back to bolinger, lieberman, sharp from the 60ies: the more predictable a {\&}quot;section of speech{\&}quot;, the more reduced it is. predictability due to language structure = language redundancy

- acoustic redundancy of a word: likelihood of recognition based on acoustic properties alone (duration reflects acoustic redundancy. longer segments are more salient)

--{\&}gt; so they make a distinction between {\&}quot;language{\&}quot; and {\&}quot;acoustic{\&}quot; redundancy. predictability based on context/word frequency vs predictability of acoustic features alone. this is weird.

- measures of acoustic redundancy:
- duration 
- spectral characteristics (formant frequencies in central portion of vowel)

- idea that articulation varies in order to reduce effort while at the same time producing signal which shows sufficient acoustic distinctiveness for listener to correctly identify linguistic content of message (already proposed by lindblom 1990)
-{\&}gt; the more language redundancy is available, the less acoustic redundancy is necessary

- other labels for the smooth signal redundancy hypothesis from studies providing support for it: probabilistic reduction hypothesis, speech efficiency

- language redundancy model: they mention a number of ways this has previously been modeled: word frequency, syllabic trigram models, accessibility, joint probability, conditional probability, Bayesian probability (??) given phonemic identity
-{\&}gt; all suppoorting the hypothesis of inverse relationship between language redundancy and acoustic realization

- their model contained 3 language redundancy groups and 3 prosodic prominence groups. predicted duration and vowel centralization in terms of F1/F2

- results:
- vowel duration: more language redundancy, shorter vowels (but difference sacross vowels). and the more prominent, the longer the vowel.
- centralization: more language redundancy, more centralization (again different for different vowels)

--{\&}gt; the analyses tend to be t tests and anovas.

- interpretation: as providing support for smooth signal redundancy, though they caution against over-interpreting the spectral results because syllables were represented by single F1 and F2 values taken at the temporal midpoint of each syllable even though formant trajectories are dynamic {\&}amp; conditioned by surrounding consonants {\&}amp; the vowel itself. eg coarticulation could also add information about surrounding segments
--{\&}gt; YES. definitely, given peter's work},

This textbook provides a straightforward introduction to the statistical analysis of language. Designed for linguists with a non-mathematical background, it clearly introduces the basic principles and methods of statistical analysis, using 'R', the leading computational statistics programme. The reader is guided step-by-step through a range of real data sets, allowing them to analyse acoustic data, construct grammatical trees for a variety of languages, quantify register variation in corpus linguistics, and measure experimental data using state-of-the-art models. The visualization of data plays a key role, both in the initial stages of data exploration and later on when the reader is encouraged to criticize various models. Containing over 40 exercises with model answers, this book will be welcomed by all linguists wishing to learn more about working with and presenting quantitative data.},

Previous studies have demonstrated talker-independent but accent-dependent learning after training on multiple talkers from a single language background. Here, listeners instead were exposed to talkers from five language backgrounds during training. After training, listeners generalized their learning to novel talkers from language backgrounds both included and not included in the training set. These findings suggest that generalization of foreign-accent adaptation is the result of exposure to systematic variability in accented speech that is similar across talkers from multiple language backgrounds.},

abstract = {Humans are adept at inferring the mental states underlying other agents' actions, such as goals, beliefs, desires, emotions and other thoughts. We propose a computational framework based on Bayesian inverse planning for modeling human action understanding. The framework represents an intuitive theory of intentional agents' behavior based on the principle of rationality: the expectation that agents will plan approximately rationally to achieve their goals, given their beliefs about the world. The mental states that caused an agent's behavior are inferred by inverting this model of rational planning using Bayesian inference, integrating the likelihood of the observed actions with the prior over mental states. This approach formalizes in precise probabilistic terms the essence of previous qualitative approaches to action understanding based on an "intentional stance" [Dennett, D. C. (1987). The intentional stance. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press] or a "teleological stance" [Gergely, G., N{\'{a}}dasdy, Z., Csibra, G., {\&} Bir{\'{o}}, S. (1995). Taking the intentional stance at 12 months of age. Cognition, 56, 165-193]. In three psychophysical experiments using animated stimuli of agents moving in simple mazes, we assess how well different inverse planning models based on different goal priors can predict human goal inferences. The results provide quantitative evidence for an approximately rational inference mechanism in human goal inference within our simplified stimulus paradigm, and for the flexible nature of goal representations that human observers can adopt. We discuss the implications of our experimental results for human action understanding in real-world contexts, and suggest how our framework might be extended to capture other kinds of mental state inferences, such as inferences about beliefs, or inferring whether an entity is an intentional agent.},

abstract = {How do children as young as 2 years of age know that numerals, like one, have exact interpretations, while quantifiers and words like a do not? Previous studies have argued that only numerals have exact lexical meanings. Children could not use scalar implicature to strengthen numeral meanings, it is argued, since they fail to do so for quantifiers [Papafragou, A., {\&} Musolino, J. (2003). Scalar implicatures: Experiments at the semantics-pragmatics interface. Cognition, 86, 253-282]. Against this view, we present evidence that children's early interpretation of numerals does rely on scalar implicature, and argue that differences between numerals and quantifiers are due to differences in the availability of the respective scales of which they are members. Evidence from previous studies establishes that (1) children can make scalar inferences when interpreting numerals, (2) children initially assign weak, non-exact interpretations to numerals when first acquiring their meanings, and (3) children can strengthen quantifier interpretations when scalar alternatives are made explicitly available.},

This paper explores the hypothesis that children fail to compute scalar implicatures because they lack knowledge of relevant scalar alternatives to words like "some". Four-year-olds were shown pictures in which three out of three objects fit a description (e.g., three animals reading), and were asked to evaluate statements that relied on context-independent alternatives (e.g., knowing that all is an alternative to some for the utterance "Some of the animals are reading") or contextual alternatives (e.g., knowing that the set of all three visible animals is an alternative to a set of two for the utterance "Only the cat and the dog are reading"). Children failed to reject the false statements containing context-independent scales even when the word only was used (e.g., only some), but correctly rejected equivalent statements containing contextual alternatives (e.g., only the cat and dog). These results support the hypothesis that children's difficulties with scalar implicature are due to a failure to generate relevant alternatives for specific scales. Consequences for number word learning are also discussed.},

abstract = {Three experiments explored the semantics of the mass-count distinction in young children and adults. In Experiments 1 and 2, the quantity judgments of participants provided evidence that some mass nouns refer to individuals, as such. Participants judged one large portion of stuff to be "more" than three tiny portions for substance-mass nouns (e.g. mustard, ketchup), but chose according to number for count nouns (e.g. shoes, candles) and object-mass nouns (e.g. furniture, jewelry). These results suggest that some mass nouns quantify over individuals, and that therefore reference to individuals does not distinguish count nouns from mass nouns. Thus, Experiments 1 and 2 failed to support the hypothesis that there exist one-to-one mappings between mass-count syntax and semantics for either adults or young children. In Experiment 3, it was found that for mass-count flexible terms (e.g. string, stone) participants based quantity judgments on number when the terms were used with count syntax, but on total amount of stuff when used with mass syntax. Apparently, the presence of discrete physical objects in a scene (e.g. stones) is not sufficient to permit quantity judgments based on number. It is proposed that object-mass nouns (e.g. furniture) can be used to refer to individuals due to lexically specified grammatical features that normally occur in count syntax. Also, we suggest that children learning language parse words that refer to individuals as count nouns unless given morpho-syntactic and referential evidence to the contrary, in which case object-mass nouns are acquired.},

Evidence is presented that this interference reflects limitations in lexical processing. In three experiments, listeners' eye movements were monitored as they searched for the target of a speaker's referring expression in a display that also contained a phonological competitor (e.g., bucket/buckle). Listeners anticipated that the speaker would refer to something in common ground, but they did not experience less interference from a competitor in privileged ground than from a matched competitor in common ground. In contrast, interference from the competitor was eliminated when it was ruled out by a semantic constraint. These findings support a view of comprehension as relying on multiple systems with distinct access to information and present a challenge for constraint-based views of common ground.},

Such studies are likely to generate anticipatory baseline effects (ABEs), differences in listeners' expectations about what a speaker might mention that exist before a critical speech stimulus is presented. ABEs show that listeners have attended to and accessed prior contextual information in time to influence the processing of the critical speech stimulus. However, further evidence is required to show that the information actually did influence subsequent processing. ABEs can compromise the validity of inferences about information integration if they are not appropriately controlled. We discuss four solutions: statistical estimation, experimental control, elimination of "on-target" trials, and neutral gaze. An experiment compares the performance of these solutions, and suggests that the elimination of on-target trials introduces bias in the direction of ABEs, due to the statistical phenomenon of regression toward the mean. We conclude that statistical estimation, possibly coupled with experimental control, offers the most valid and least biased solution.},

abstract = {Human observers localize events in the world by using sensory signals from multiple modalities. We evaluated two theories of spatial localization that predict how visual and auditory information are weighted when these signals specify different locations in space. According to one theory (visual capture), the signal that is typically most reliable dominates in a winner-take-all competition, whereas the other theory (maximum-likelihood estimation) proposes that perceptual judgments are based on a weighted average of the sensory signals in proportion to each signal's relative reliability. Our results indicate that both theories are partially correct, in that relative signal reliability significantly altered judgments of spatial location, but these judgments were also characterized by an overall bias to rely on visual over auditory information. These results have important implications for the development of cue integration and for neural plasticity in the adult brain that enables humans to optimally integrate multimodal information.},

abstract = {Capacity limits in linguistic short-term memory (STM) are typically measured with forward span tasks in which participants are asked to recall lists of words in the order presented. Using such tasks, native signers of American Sign Language (ASL) exhibit smaller spans than native speakers ([Boutla, M., Supalla, T., Newport, E. L., {\&} Bavelier, D. (2004). Short-term memory span: Insights from sign language. Nature Neuroscience, 7(9), 997-1002]). Here, we test the hypothesis that this population difference reflects differences in the way speakers and signers maintain temporal order information in short-term memory. We show that native signers differ from speakers on measures of short-term memory that require maintenance of temporal order of the tested materials, but not on those in which temporal order is not required. In addition, we show that, in a recall task with free order, bilingual subjects are more likely to recall in temporal order when using English than ASL. We conclude that speakers and signers do share common short-term memory processes. However, whereas short-term memory for spoken English is predominantly organized in terms of temporal order, we argue that this dimension does not play as great a role in signers' short-term memory. Other factors that may affect STM processes in signers are discussed.},

Importantly, we argue that in most tasks of interest, and particularly complex ones, suboptimal inference is likely to be the dominant component of behavioral variability. This perspective explains a variety of intriguing observations, including why variability appears to be larger on the sensory than on the motor side, and why our sensors are sometimes surprisingly unreliable.},

To ensure optimal decision-making, the weight given to decision outcomes should reflect their salience in predicting future outcomes, and this salience should be modulated by the volatility of the reward environment. We show that human subjects assess volatility in an optimal manner and adjust decision-making accordingly. This optimal estimate of volatility is reflected in the fMRI signal in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) when each trial outcome is observed. When a new piece of information is witnessed, activity levels reflect its salience for predicting future outcomes. Furthermore, variations in this ACC signal across the population predict variations in subject learning rates. Our results provide a formal account of how we weigh our different experiences in guiding our future actions.},

For instance, depending on the speaker's level of expertise, uttering Some squirrels hibernate can imply that not all squirrels hibernate, or it might imply the weaker proposition that the speaker does not know whether all squirrels hibernate. The present study examines the extent to which speaker knowledge influences implied meanings as well as the timing of any such influence. Using a self-paced presentation, participants read sentences containing some in contexts where a speaker should know whether all was true, or where the speaker merely might know whether all was true. This knowledge manipulation was found to have immediate and reliable effects on the type of inference that was drawn. In contrast, knowledge played no role when the same meanings were conveyed literally. This work thus demonstrates that perceivers consider the speaker's knowledge state incrementally to establish the speaker's communicative goals.

abstract = {We describe an ideal observer model for estimating "shape from texture" which is derived from the principles of statistical information. For a given family of surface shapes, measures of statistical information can be computed for two different texture cues--density and orientation of texels. These measures can be used to predict lower bounds on the variance of shape judgements of "ideal" and human observers. They can also predict optimal weights for cue integration for the inference of shape from texture. These weights are directly proportional to the information carried by each cue. The ideal observer model therefore predicts that the variance of subjects' responses in a psychophysical shape judgement task should reflect the statistical importance of individual texture cues. Our results show that human performance in shape judgements for a one-parameter family of parabolic cylinders is often better than what an ideal observer achieves using a density cue alone. Therefore other information, for example the compression cue, must be used by human observers. For the first time, such results have been obtained without recourse to the unnatural cue conflict paradigms used in previous experiments. The model makes further predictions for the perception of planar slanted surfaces in the case of wide field of view.},

abstract = {Used a syntactic priming procedure with 48 undergraduates to examine the implications for theories of language performance of the claim that activation processes have an impact on the mechanisms of language use, including those responsible for syntactic structure in speech. On each priming trial, Ss produced a priming sentence in 1 of several syntactic forms. They then viewed an unrelated event in a picture and described it in 1 sentence. Findings show that the probability of a particular syntactic form being used in the description increased when that form had occurred in the prime, under presentation conditions that minimized Ss' attention to their speech, to the syntactic features of the priming sentences, and to connections between the priming sentences and the subsequent pictures. This syntactic repetition effect suggests that sentence formulation processes are somewhat inertial and subject to such probabilistic factors as the frequency or recency of use of particular structural forms. Exps II and III, each with 48 undergraduates, showed that this effect was not appreciably modified by variations in conceptual characteristics of sentences. Overall results reveal that the effects of priming were specific to features of sentence form, independent of sentence content. The empirical isolability of structural features from conceptual characteristics of successive utterances is consistent with the assumption that some syntactic processes are organized into a functionally independent subsystem. Priming sentences and test instructions for Exp I are appended. (49 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {Accounts of the scalar inference from 'some X-ed' to 'not all X-ed' are central to the debate between contemporary theories of conversational pragmatics. An important contribution to this debate is to identify contexts that decrease the endorsement rate of the inference. We suggest that the inference is endorsed less often in face-threatening contexts, i.e., when X implies a loss of face for the listener. This claim is successfully tested in Experiment 1. Experiment 2 rules out a possible confound between face-threatening contexts and lower-bound contexts. Experiment 3 shows that whilst saying 'some X-ed' when one knew for a fact that all X-ed is always perceived as an underinformative utterance, it is also seen as a nice and polite thing to do when X threatens the face of the listener. These findings are considered from the perspective of Relevance Theory as well as that of the Generalized Conversational Inference approach.},

abstract = {Speaking is one of the most complex actions that we perform, but nearly all of us learn to do it effortlessly. Production of fluent speech requires the precise, coordinated movement of multiple articulators (for example, the lips, jaw, tongue and larynx) over rapid time scales. Here we used high-resolution, multi-electrode cortical recordings during the production of consonant-vowel syllables to determine the organization of speech sensorimotor cortex in humans. We found speech-articulator representations that are arranged somatotopically on ventral pre- and post-central gyri, and that partially overlap at individual electrodes. These representations were coordinated temporally as sequences during syllable production. Spatial patterns of cortical activity showed an emergent, population-level representation, which was organized by phonetic features. Over tens of milliseconds, the spatial patterns transitioned between distinct representations for different consonants and vowels. These results reveal the dynamic organization of speech sensorimotor cortex during the generation of multi-articulator movements that underlies our ability to speak.},

abstract = {The information that individuals can hold in working memory is quite limited, but researchers have typically studied this capacity using simple objects or letter strings with no associations between them. However, in the real world there are strong associations and regularities in the input. In an information theoretic sense, regularities introduce redundancies that make the input more compressible. The current study shows that observers can take advantage of these redundancies, enabling them to remember more items in working memory. In 2 experiments, covariance was introduced between colors in a display so that over trials some color pairs were more likely to appear than other color pairs. Observers remembered more items from these displays than from displays where the colors were paired randomly. The improved memory performance cannot be explained by simply guessing the high-probability color pair, suggesting that observers formed more efficient representations to remember more items. Further, as observers learned the regularities, their working memory performance improved in a way that is quantitatively predicted by a Bayesian learning model and optimal encoding scheme. These results suggest that the underlying capacity of the individuals' working memory is unchanged, but the information they have to remember can be encoded in a more compressed fashion.},

abstract = {We report three experiments that investigated whether the linguistic behavior of participants in a dialogue is affected by their role within that interaction. All experiments were concerned with the way in which speakers choose between syntactic forms with very similar meanings. Theories of dialogue assume that speakers address their contributions directly to their addressees, but also indirectly to side participants. In Experiments 1 and 2, speakers produced picture descriptions that had the same syntactic structure as a previous speaker's descriptions which had been addressed to a third person. This indicated that syntactic alignment is not limited to speaker-addressee dyads. However, the prior participant role of the current speaker affected alignment: prior addressees aligned more than prior side-participants. In contrast, Experiments 2 and 3 demonstrated that alignment was unaffected by the prior participant role of the current addressee. We interpret these findings in terms of depth of processing during encoding.},

abstract = {There is a growing body of evidence showing that conversational implicatures are rapidly accessed in incremental utterance interpretation. To date, studies showing incremental access have focussed on implicatures related to linguistic triggers, such as 'some' and 'or'. We discuss three kinds of on-line model that can account for this data. A model built around the notion of linguistic alternatives stored in the lexicon would only account for linguistically triggered implicatures of the kind already studied and not so-called 'particularised' implicatures that are not associated with specific linguistic items. A second model built around the idea of focus alternatives could handle both linguistically triggered implicatures and so-called particularised implicatures but would be insensitive to the role that information about the speaker's mental state plays in deriving implicatures. A third more fully 'Gricean' model takes account of the speaker's mental state in accessing these implications. In this paper we present a visual world study using a new interactive paradigm where two communicators (one confederate) describe visually-presented events to each other as their eye movements are monitored. In this way, we directly compare the suitability of these three kinds of model. We show hearers can access contextually specific particularised implicatures in on-line comprehension. Moreover, we show that in doing so, hearers are sensitive to the relevant mental states of the speaker. We conclude with a discussion of how a more 'Gricean' model may be developed and of how our findings inform a long-standing debate on the immediacy of on-line perspective taking in language comprehension.},

@article{Breheny2006,
abstract = {Recent research in semantics and pragmatics has revived the debate about whether there are two cognitively distinct categories of conversational implicatures: generalised and particularised. Generalised conversational implicatures are so-called because they seem to arise more or less independently of contextual support. Particularised implicatures are more context-bound. The Default view is that generalised implicatures are default inferences and that their computation is relatively autonomous--being computed by some default mechanism and only being open to cancellation at a second stage when contextual assumptions are taken into consideration (i.a.). It is at that second stage where contextual assumptions are considered that particularised implications are computed. By contrast, Context-Driven theorists claim that both generalised and particularised implicatures are generated by the same process and only where there is contextual support (Chierchia, 2004; Horn, 1984; Levinson, 2000 i.a.). In this paper, we present three on-line studies of the prototypical cases of generalised implicatures: the scalar implicatures 'some of the Fs' > 'not all the Fs' and 'X or Y' > 'either X or Y but not both'. These studies were designed to test the context-dependence and autonomy of the implicatures. Our results suggest that these scalar implicatures are dependent on the conversational context and that they show none of the autonomy predicted by the Default view. We conclude with a discussion of the degree to which such implicatures are purely context-driven and whether an interactionist default position may also be plausible.},

abstract = {When people in conversation refer repeatedly to the same object, they come to use the same terms. This phenomenon, called lexical entrainment, has several possible explanations. Ahistorical accounts appeal only to the informativeness and availability of terms and to the current salience of the object's features. Historical accounts appeal in addition to the recency and frequency of past references and to partner-specific conceptualizations of the object that people achieve interactively. Evidence from 3 experiments favors a historical account and suggests that when speakers refer to an object, they are proposing a conceptualization of it, a proposal their addresses may or may not agree to. Once they do establish a shared conceptualization, a conceptual pact, they appeal to it in later references even when they could use simpler references. Over time, speakers simplify conceptual pacts and, when necessary, abandon them for new conceptualizations.},

abstract = {During conversation, interlocutors build on the set of shared beliefs known as common ground. Although there is general agreement that interlocutors maintain representations of common ground, there is no consensus regarding whether common-ground representations constrain initial language interpretation processes. Here, I propose that executive functioning--specifically, failures in inhibition control--can account for some occasional insensitivities to common-ground information. The present article presents the results of an experiment that demonstrates that individual differences in inhibition control determine the degree to which addressees successfully inhibit perspective-inappropriate interpretations of temporary referential ambiguities in their partner's speech. Whether mentioned information was grounded or not also played a role, suggesting that addressees may show sensitivity to common ground only when it is established collaboratively. The results suggest that, in conversation, perspective information routinely guides online language processing and that occasional insensitivities to perspective can be attributed partly to difficulties in inhibiting perspective-inappropriate interpretations.},

These lexically entrained terms (Garrod {\&} Anderson, 1987) are part of the common ground between the particular individuals who established the entrained term (Brennan {\&} Clark, 1996), and are thought to be encoded in memory with a partner-specific cue. Thus far, analyses of the time-course of interpretation suggest that partner-specific information may not constrain the initial interpretation of referring expressions (Kronm{\"{u}}ller {\&} Barr, 2007; Barr {\&} Keysar, 2002). However, these studies used non-interactive paradigms, which may limit the use of partner-specific representations. This article presents the results of three eye-tracking experiments. Experiment 1a used an interactive conversation methodology in which the experimenter and participant jointly established entrained terms for various images. On critical trials, the same experimenter, or a new experimenter described a critical image using an entrained term, or a new term. The results demonstrated an early, on-line partner-specific effect for interpretation of entrained terms, as well as preliminary evidence for an early, partner-specific effect for new terms. Experiment 1b used a non-interactive paradigm in which participants completed the same task by listening to image descriptions recorded during Experiment 1a; the results showed that partner-specific effects were eliminated. Experiment 2 replicated the partner-specific findings of Experiment 1a with an interactive paradigm and scenes that contained previously unmentioned images. The results suggest that partner-specific interpretation is most likely to occur in interactive dialog settings; the number of critical trials and stimulus characteristics may also play a role. The results are consistent with a large body of work demonstrating that the language processing system uses a rich source of contextual and pragmatic representations to guide on-line processing decisions.},

abstract = {During unscripted speech, speakers coordinate the formulation of pre-linguistic messages with the linguistic processes that implement those messages into speech. We examine the process of constructing a contextually appropriate message and interfacing that message with utterance planning in English (the small butterfly) and Spanish (la mariposa peque{\~{n}}a) during an unscripted, interactive task. The coordination of gaze and speech during formulation of these messages is used to evaluate two hypotheses regarding the lower-limit on the size of message planning units, namely whether messages are planned in units isomorphous to entire phrases or units isomorphous to single lexical items. Comparing the planning of fluent pre-nominal adjectives in English and post-nominal adjectives in Spanish showed that size information is added to the message later in Spanish than English, suggesting that speakers can prepare pre-linguistic messages in lexically-sized units. The results also suggest that speakers can use disfluency to coordinate the transition from thought to speech. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

annote = {        Framing: Is production adapted to comprehension? And if so, why?
        
In Experiment 1 they answer the first question in the positive. In experiment 2, three different accounts are tested against each other (they conclude their evidence supports 3. I think they were probably testing 1. and 2. against each other and then had to come up with a post hoc story why the evidence didn't turn out as expected):
Production is adapted to comprehension because...
	1. {\&}quot;Listener-need{\&}quot; account (Gricean audience design type story)
	2. Speaker experience account: production reflects speakers' own comprehension experience
	3. Conceptual constraints: parallel processes for comprehension to conceptual structure as for conceptual structure to production
                  
Test case: instrument omission.          
Methodology: production studies in a recall paradigm. Stories with different instruments and context are retold by subjects.
                  
Experiment 1        
        Method: 2x2, instrument typicality (typical or not) and importance (for the story - important vs unimportant)
        Prediction: Atypical instruments should be mentioned more, important instruments should be mentioned more.
        Results: More typical instruments ommitted more. Effect of importance only in 1 category: separate clause after verb.
        
        Experiment 2        
        Method: 2x2x2x2: instrument typicality, picture informativeness (informative: showing instrument, uninformative: not showing instrument), did speaker see picture before or after they read the passage, did listener see picture as speaker told story
        Prediction: if listener-need account is correct, then typicality effect should disappear if listener gets instrument information from other source (ie sees picture). if speaker-experience account is correct, effect should disappear if speaker gets information from additional source
        Results: somewhat more instrument mentions for ignorant hearers (some support for audience design). overall just big main effect of typicality. but also some support for availability-based production: more typical instruments tend to be mentioned BEFORE verb, less typical ones AFTER. this could also be a UID effect. 
                  
Conclusion: They propose a box model with a quantitative component that builds on macro-propositions. There are multiple points of possible interference, that's why the results aren't directly pro audience design or pro speaker-need. They conclude that the default is to not specify instruments and only when necessary, mention them.
                  
Problems: The model is strange. Typical box model stuff, unclear where it all comes from. Methodologically, it's not clear that the items are frequency-matched (they probably aren't), so it's hard to tell whether the effect is really due to typicality or just sth simple like frequency. Of course in this case one might argue that they should be highly co-linear, since we tend to talk more about more frequently occurring things (like knives, rather than ice-picks). However, they found precisely that more typical (and thus supposedly more frequently occurring) instruments are the ones that are ommitted more, so they should be talked about less (in these particular constructions) than less typical objects. 
        
Relation between frequency and predictability here?

abstract = {Accurate calibration of sensory estimators is critical for maintaining accurate estimates of the environment. Classically, it was assumed that sensory calibration occurs by one sense changing to become consistent with vision; this is visual dominance. Recently, it has been proposed that changes in estimators occur according to their relative reliabilities; this is the reliability-based model. We show that if cue combination occurs according to relative reliability, then reliability-based calibration assures minimum-variance sensory estimates over time. Recent studies are qualitatively consistent with the reliability-based model, but none have shown that the predictions are quantitatively accurate. We conducted an experiment in which the model could be assessed quantitatively. Subjects indicated whether visual, haptic, and visual-haptic planar surfaces appeared slanted positively or negatively from frontoparallel. In preadaptation, we determined the visual and haptic slants of perceived frontoparallel, and measured visual and haptic reliabilities. We varied visual reliability by adjusting the size of the viewable stimulus. Haptic reliability was fixed. During adaptation, subjects were exposed to visual-haptic surfaces with a discrepancy between the visual and haptic slants. After adaptation, we remeasured the visual and haptic slants of perceived frontoparallel. When vision was more reliable, haptics adapted to match vision. When vision was less reliable, vision adapted to match haptics. Most importantly, the ratio of visual and haptic adaptation was quantitatively predicted by relative reliability. The amount of adaptation of one sensory estimator relative to another depends strongly on the relative reliabilities of the two estimators.},

abstract = {It is not known how egocentric visual information (location of a target relative to the self) and allocentric visual information (location of a target relative to external landmarks) are integrated to form reach plans. Based on behavioral data from rodents and humans we hypothesized that the degree of stability in visual landmarks would influence the relative weighting. Furthermore, based on numerous cue-combination studies we hypothesized that the reach system would act like a maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE), where the reliability of both cues determines their relative weighting. To predict how these factors might interact we developed an MLE model that weighs egocentric and allocentric information based on their respective reliabilities, and also on an additional stability heuristic. We tested the predictions of this model in 10 human subjects by manipulating landmark stability and reliability (via variable amplitude vibration of the landmarks and variable amplitude gaze shifts) in three reach-to-touch tasks: an egocentric control (reaching without landmarks), an allocentric control (reaching relative to landmarks), and a cue-conflict task (involving a subtle landmark "shift" during the memory interval). Variability from all three experiments was used to derive parameters for the MLE model, which was then used to simulate egocentric-allocentric weighting in the cue-conflict experiment. As predicted by the model, landmark vibration--despite its lack of influence on pointing variability (and thus allocentric reliability) in the control experiment--had a strong influence on egocentric-allocentric weighting. A reduced model without the stability heuristic was unable to reproduce this effect. These results suggest heuristics for extrinsic cue stability are at least as important as reliability for determining cue weighting in memory-guided reaching.},

This review examines probabilistic models defined over traditional symbolic structures. Language comprehension and production involve probabilistic inference in such models; and acquisition involves choosing the best model, given innate constraints and linguistic and other input. Probabilistic models can account for the learning and processing of language, while maintaining the sophistication of symbolic models. A recent burgeoning of theoretical developments and online corpus creation has enabled large models to be tested, revealing probabilistic constraints in processing, undermining acquisition arguments based on a perceived poverty of the stimulus, and suggesting fruitful links with probabilistic theories of categorization and ambiguity resolution in perception.},

abstract = {Spatial judgments and actions are often based on multiple cues. The authors review a multitude of phenomena on the integration of spatial cues in diverse species to consider how nearly optimally animals combine the cues. Under the banner of Bayesian perception, cues are sometimes combined and weighted in a near optimal fashion. In other instances when cues are combined, how optimal the integration is might be unclear. Only 1 cue may be relied on, or cues may seem to compete with one another. The authors attempt to bring some order to the diversity by taking into account the subjective discrepancy in the dictates of multiple cues. When cues are too discrepant, it may be best to rely on 1 cue source. When cues are not too discrepant, it may be advantageous to combine cues. Such a dual principle provides an extended Bayesian framework for understanding the functional reasons for the integration of spatial cues.},

In the model we propose, the speaker initiates the process by presenting or inviting a noun phrase. Before going on to the next contribution, the participants, if necessary, repair, expand on, or replace the noun phrase in an iterative process until they reach a version they mutually accept. In doing so they try to minimize their joint effort. The preferred procedure is for the speaker to present a simple noun phrase and for the addressee to accept it by allowing the next contribution to begin. We describe a communication task in which pairs of people conversed about arranging complex figures and show how the proposed model accounts for many features of the references they produced. The model follows, we suggest, from the mutual responsibility that participants in conversation bear toward the understanding of each utterance.

annote = {- study of language use vs language structure

- language as product tradition: competence/performance distinction, with competence being people's tacit language knowledge (grammar). performance only a reflection of competences, subject to additional principles

- language as action tradition (Austin, Grice, Searle): doing things with language. uttering words/sentences; issue utterances; make assertiens, requests; try to get other to believe things, divulge information, become frightened. intention recognition

- three tenets of language use in action tradition:
1. utterances are more basic than sentences. (product: sentences more basic than utterances)
2. speaker meaning is primary, and word or sentence meaning are derivative (product: comopsitional semantics to get sentence meaning, compute speaker meaning from there)
3. speaking and listening are not autonomous activities, but parts of collective ones 

- 3 properties of the arenas that language takes place in
1. participants (speaker, addressees, overhearers) with roles (eg teacher student)
2. social processes (guiding language exchange. eg gossip, business transaction)
3. collective actions (communication as collaborative effort like playing piano duet)

- 4 issues of language use:
1. common ground (definition; how is it used?)
2. collaborative processes (how is language a coll. process?)
3. audience design (what is it, do we do it?)
4. coordination of meaning (against simple lexical semantics. coordinate meanings of words)

DEFINITE REFERENCE AND MUTUAL KNOWLEDGE (1981) 

How do people plan definite reference?
Goal: resolve the Mutual Knowledge Paradox - how do we choose a referring expression from an infinitely long list of referring expressions in finite time?
--{\&}gt; to get at the following two questions:
1. What type of shared knowledge is needed for language use?
2. How is that shared knowledge in practice assessed and secured?

Two solutions to the paradox (Situation: {\&}quot;Monkey Business{\&}quot; at the Roxy. Ann to Bob: Have you ever seen the movie that's showing at the Roxy tonight?)
1. Truncation heuristics -- get rid of assumption 1.

2. Copresence heuristics (favored) - search memory for evidence that speaker, listener, and object being referred to co-occurred physically, linguistically, or indirectly (condition of being openly present together)


Conditions:
1. Ann knows that t is R.
2. Ann knows that Bob knows that t is R.
3. Ann knows that Bob knows that Ann knows that t is R.
4. Ann knows that Bob knows that Ann knows that Bob knows that t is R.
5. Ann knows that Bob knows that Ann knows that Bob knows that Ann knows that t is R.
.
.
.
regress leading to processing paradox. 

Assumptions underlying the paradox:
1. Ann tries to make {\_}felicitous{\_} definite references.
2. To make a felicitous reference Ann must assure herself of all the infinite conditions.
3. Each of the conditions takes a finite amount of time to check.
4. Ann makes definite reference in a finite amount of time.

mutual knowledge = shared{\_}inf knowledge
--{\&}gt; recursive definition:
A and B mutually know that p={\_}def. (q) A and B know that p and that q.

The location theory of reference
Acts performed in using the definite article:
1. Speaker introduces a referent/referents to the hearer.
2. Speaker instructs hearer to locate referent in shared set of objects
3. Speaker refers to totality of objects or mass within this set that satisfy the referring expression.

HEARERS AND SPEECH ACTS (1982) 

In addition to speaker and addressee, introduce extra hearer type {\_}participant{\_}, towards whom the speaker's illocutionary acts are also addressed. Addressee is participant is hearer.

3 hypotheses:
Participant Hypothesis - certain illocutionary acts directed at addressees, others at participants
Informative Hypothesis - speaker informs all participants fully of illocutionary act being performed towards addressee
Informative-First Hypothesis - all addressee-directed illocutionary acts are performed over informatives

Linear vs lateral illocutionary acts (direct and indirect addressee the same/different)

Speaker assigns 1 of three roles to hearers: addressee, participant, overhearer
(*too rigid*) - Principle of Responsibility

Known vs. unknown overhearers

Conditions for informatives:
1. preparatory condition
2. sincerity condition
3. propositional content conditions
4. existential condition

abstract = {Abstract-Contributing to conversation, it is proposed, is accomplished in two phases. In the presentation phase, one participant ordinarily presents a stretch of speech intended to specify the content of his or her contribution. In the acceptance phase, all the participants work together to establish the mutual belief that everyone else has understood that content well enough for current purposes. The two phases together constitute a unit of conversation we call a contribution. The two phases may each have contributions embedded within them, so conversations consist of both sequential and hierarchical arrangements of contributions. As evidence for these proposals, we examine four types of contributions that occurred in directory enquiries of the telephone company. From this and other evidence, we argue that contributions appear to be a general feature of conversations.},

abstract = {Speakers often repeat the first word of major constituents, as in, "I uh I wouldn't be surprised at that." Repeats like this divide into four stages: an initial commitment to the constituent (with "I"); the suspension of speech; a hiatus in speaking (filled with "uh"); and a restart of the constituent ("I wouldn't."). An analysis of all repeated articles and pronouns in two large corpora of spontaneous speech shows that the four stages reflect different principles. Speakers are more likely to make a premature commitment, immediately suspending their speech, as both the local constituent and the constituent containing it become more complex. They plan some of these suspensions from the start as preliminary commitments to what they are about to say. And they are more likely to restart a constituent the more their stopping has disrupted its delivery. We argue that the principles governing these stages are general and not specific to repeats.},

abstract = {Listeners are exquisitely sensitive to fine-grained acoustic detail within phonetic categories for sounds and words. Here we show that this sensitivity is optimal given the probabilistic nature of speech cues. We manipulated the probability distribution of one probabilistic cue, voice onset time (VOT), which differentiates word initial labial stops in English (e.g., "beach" and "peach"). Participants categorized words from distributions of VOT with wide or narrow variances. Uncertainty about word identity was measured by four-alternative forced-choice judgments and by the probability of looks to pictures. Both measures closely reflected the posterior probability of the word given the likelihood distributions of VOT, suggesting that listeners are sensitive to these distributions.},

- measure: probability of looks to picture

**********************************
- framing: goald of speech perception: find most likely intended message given noisy acoustic signal
- apply ideal observer model: assumption that world provides only probabilistic info, inherently ambiguous. assumption that decisions should be made using all available information
	--{\&}gt; second assumption poorly worded. should be: all available RELEVANT information. and in some sense this is where it gets circular - because if it's used, you infer it's relevant, if it's not used, you infer it isn't. 
- if hearers are optimal, they should take into acount info about entire distribution for information source, because that tells you sth about how reliable that cue is. so:
	- hypothesis: listeners should be sensitive to entire distribution of acoustic-phonetic cues for word {\&}amp; precision/amount of certainty (subjective) about a word that cue provides should be weighted inversely proportional to cue variance for that word
        
- stimuli: beach...peach VOT continuum, one group gets two wide distributions (variance 14ms), one two narrow distributions (variance 8ms) centered around 0 and 50ms
- predictions:
	- posterior probability of other category increases for VOT values closer to category boundary
	- increase in posterior prob not linear. should vary little around mean and then increase rapidly near category boundary
		--{\&}gt; why?
	- posterior prob is function of uncertainty in distributions. more looks to competitor/choice of competitor  in high-variance condition
- results: yippie. predictions borne out.
	- categorization slopes differed. well predicted by cue distribution

abstract = {What makes a discourse coherent? One potential factor has been discussed in the linguistic literature in terms of a Question under Discussion (QUD). This approach claims that discourse proceeds by continually raising explicit or implicit questions, viewed as sets of alternatives, or competing descriptions of the world. If the interlocutor accepts the question, it becomes the QUD, a narrowed set of alternatives to be addressed (Roberts, in press). Three eye movement recording studies are reported that investigated the effect of a preceding explicit QUD (Experiment 1) or implicit QUD (Experiments 2 and 3) on the processing of following text. Experiment 1 revealed an effect of whether the question queried alternative propositions or alternative entities. Reading times in the answer were faster when the answer it provided was of the same semantic type as was queried. Experiment 2 tested QUDs implied by the alternative description of reality introduced by a non-actuality implicature trigger such as should X or want to X. The results, when combined with the results of Experiment 3 (which ruled out a possible alternative interpretation) showed disrupted reading of a following verb phrase that failed to resolve the implicit QUD (Did the discourse participant actually X?), compared to reading the same material in the absence of a clear QUD. The findings support an online role for QUDs in guiding readers' structuring and interpretation of discourse.},

- why do speakers produce dispreferred structures in the first place?
	1. availability-based production (bock {\&}amp; warren 1985, ferreira {\&}amp; dell 2000):  because theyproduce available material first, which sometimes results in dispreferred structure
	-{\&}gt; prediction: there should be no difference in difficulty when speakers produce preferred vs dispreferred structure because those structures produced precisely when beneficial
	--{\&}gt; i don't really think this follows. there may still be a penalty for ON AVERAGE dispreferred structures
	2. competition-based models (haskell {\&}amp; macdonald 2003, solomon {\&}amp; pearlmutter 2004): because the structure more active at moment of choice, given interactions among all operating constraints
	-{\&}gt; prediction: dispreferred structures should be more difficult because of more competition
	--{\&}gt; again, i'm not sure this follows. if you have a constraint that particularly strongly activates the dispreferred structure, there shouldn't be much competition
	3. computational levels accounts, eg UID: dispreferred structures have lower probability of occurring in the context where they are dispreferred, they necessarily encode more info 
	-{\&}gt; prediction: speakers should provide more signal when producing less preferred structures (eg speaking slower, insert disfluencies, gesturing)

abstract = {Survival can depend on the ability to change a current course of action to respond to potentially advantageous or threatening stimuli. This "reorienting" response involves the coordinated action of a right hemisphere dominant ventral frontoparietal network that interrupts and resets ongoing activity and a dorsal frontoparietal network specialized for selecting and linking stimuli and responses. At rest, each network is distinct and internally correlated, but when attention is focused, the ventral network is suppressed to prevent reorienting to distracting events. These different patterns of recruitment may reflect inputs to the ventral attention network from the locus coeruleus/norepinephrine system. While originally conceptualized as a system for redirecting attention from one object to another, recent evidence suggests a more general role in switching between networks, which may explain recent evidence of its involvement in functions such as social cognition.},

abstract = {The systematic biases seen in people's probability judgments are typically taken as evidence that people do not use the rules of probability theory when reasoning about probability but instead use heuristics, which sometimes yield reasonable judgments and sometimes yield systematic biases. This view has had a major impact in economics, law, medicine, and other fields; indeed, the idea that people cannot reason with probabilities has become a truism. We present a simple alternative to this view, where people reason about probability according to probability theory but are subject to random variation or noise in the reasoning process. In this account the effect of noise is canceled for some probabilistic expressions. Analyzing data from 2 experiments, we find that, for these expressions, people's probability judgments are strikingly close to those required by probability theory. For other expressions, this account produces systematic deviations in probability estimates. These deviations explain 4 reliable biases in human probabilistic reasoning (conservatism, subadditivity, conjunction, and disjunction fallacies). These results suggest that people's probability judgments embody the rules of probability theory and that biases in those judgments are due to the effects of random noise.

abstract = {Miller (1956) summarized evidence that people can remember about seven chunks in short-term memory (STM) tasks. However, that number was meant more as a rough estimate and a rhetorical device than as a real capacity limit. Others have since suggested that there is a more precise capacity limit, but that it is only three to five chunks. The present target article brings together a wide variety of data on capacity limits suggesting that the smaller capacity limit is real. Capacity limits will be useful in analyses of information processing only if the boundary conditions for observing them can be carefully described. Four basic conditions in which chunks can be identified and capacity limits can accordingly be observed are: (1) when information overload limits chunks to individual stimulus items, (2) when other steps are taken specifically to block the recording of stimulus items into larger chunks, (3) in performance discontinuities caused by the capacity limit, and (4) in various indirect effects of the capacity limit. Under these conditions, rehearsal and long-term memory cannot be used to combine stimulus items into chunks of an unknown size; nor can storage mechanisms that are not capacity-limited, such as sensory memory, allow the capacity-limited storage mechanism to be refilled during recall. A single, central capacity limit averaging about four chunks is implicated along with other, noncapacity-limited sources. The pure STM capacity limit expressed in chunks is distinguished from compound STM limits obtained when the number of separately held chunks is unclear. Reasons why pure capacity estimates fall within a narrow range are discussed and a capacity limit for the focus of attention is proposed.},

abstract = {Two experiments used the head-mounted eye-tracking methodology to examine the time course of lexical activation in the face of a non-phonemic cue, talker variation. We found that lexical competition was attenuated by consistent talker differences between words that would otherwise be lexical competitors. In Experiment 1, some English cohort word-pairs were consistently spoken by a single talker (male couch, male cows), while other word-pairs were spoken by different talkers (male sheep, female sheet). After repeated instances of talker-word pairings, words from different-talker pairs showed smaller proportions of competitor fixations than words from same-talker pairs. In Experiment 2, participants learned to identify black-and-white shapes from novel labels spoken by one of two talkers. All of the 16 novel labels were VCVCV word-forms atypical of, but not phonologically illegal in, English. Again, a word was consistently spoken by one talker, and its cohort or rhyme competitor was consistently spoken either by that same talker (same-talker competitor) or the other talker (different-talker competitor). Targets with different-talker cohorts received greater fixation proportions than targets with same-talker cohorts, while the reverse was true for fixations to cohort competitors; there were fewer erroneous selections of competitor referents for different-talker competitors than same-talker competitors. Overall, these results support a view of the lexicon in which entries contain extra-phonemic information. Extensions of the artificial lexicon paradigm and developmental implications are discussed.},

abstract = {Several aspects of the viewing situation affect the ability to determine heading from optical flow. These include the amount of depth variation and number of texture elements in the scene, the location and amount of the visual field stimulated, and the position of the focus of expansion within the stimulus. Without a quantification of the discrimination information provided by the stimuli presented to the observer, it is impossible to determine how much of an observed change in performance reflects the properties of neural mechanisms and strategies employed by the observer. To enable a better quantification, we developed an ideal observer for the discrimination of heading from random-dot flow fields. Internal noises of the ideal observer were set by the results of single-dot velocity discrimination experiments. We compared human and ideal observer performance in discriminating headings with different patterns of flow (e.g. radial vs laminar) presented on different parts of the retina. Efficiency--the ratio of ideal and human thresholds--was fairly constant for the various flow patterns and retinal eccentricities. This outcome indicates that most of the variation in human observers' ability to estimate heading from the flow patterns and retinal loci considered here is due to changes in the discrimination information provided by the stimulus after measurement by the visual system. In the discussion, we show how the ideal observer can be used to quantify the spatial distribution of heading discrimination information for any observer translation through any scene represented by dots.},

The service has attracted attention from experimental psychologists interested in gathering human subject data more efficiently. However, relative to traditional laboratory studies, many aspects of the testing environment are not under the experimenter's control. In this paper, we attempt to empirically evaluate the fidelity of the AMT system for use in cognitive behavioral experiments. These types of experiment differ from simple surveys in that they require multiple trials, sustained attention from participants, comprehension of complex instructions, and millisecond accuracy for response recording and stimulus presentation. We replicate a diverse body of tasks from experimental psychology including the Stroop, Switching, Flanker, Simon, Posner Cuing, attentional blink, subliminal priming, and category learning tasks using participants recruited using AMT. While most of replications were qualitatively successful and validated the approach of collecting data anonymously online using a web-browser, others revealed disparity between laboratory results and online results. A number of important lessons were encountered in the process of conducting these replications that should be of value to other researchers.},

In Experiment 1, a referent picture (e.g., the picture of a bench) was presented along with three pictures, two of which had names that shared the same initial phonemes as the name of the referent (e.g., bed and bell). Participants were more likely to fixate the picture with the higher frequency name (bed) than the picture with the lower frequency name (bell). In Experiment 2, referent pictures were presented with three unrelated distractors. Fixation latencies to referents with high-frequency names were shorter than those to referents with low-frequency names. The proportion of fixations to the referents and distractors were analyzed in 33-ms time slices to provide fine-grained information about the time course of frequency effects. These analyses established that frequency affects the earliest moments of lexical access and rule out a late-acting, decision-bias locus for frequency. Simulations using models in which frequency operates on resting-activation levels, on connection strengths, and as a postactivation decision bias provided further constraints on the locus of frequency effects.},

As the first sounds of the referent's name were heard, the participants were more likely to fixate the visual competitor than to fixate either of the distractor objects. Moreover, this effect was not modulated by the visual similarity between the referent and competitor pictures, independently estimated in a visual similarity rating task.

        Framing: Is production adapted to comprehension? And if so, why?
        
In Experiment 1 they answer the first question in the positive. In experiment 2, three different accounts are tested against each other (they conclude their evidence supports 3. I think they were probably testing 1. and 2. against each other and then had to come up with a post hoc story why the evidence didn't turn out as expected):
Production is adapted to comprehension because...
	1. {\&}quot;Listener-need{\&}quot; account (Gricean audience design type story)
	2. Speaker experience account: production reflects speakers' own comprehension experience
	3. Conceptual constraints: parallel processes for comprehension to conceptual structure as for conceptual structure to production
                  
Test case: instrument omission.          
Methodology: production studies in a recall paradigm. Stories with different instruments and context are retold by subjects.
                  
Experiment 1        
        Method: 2x2, instrument typicality (typical or not) and importance (for the story - important vs unimportant)
        Prediction: Atypical instruments should be mentioned more, important instruments should be mentioned more.
        Results: More typical instruments ommitted more. Effect of importance only in 1 category: separate clause after verb.
        
        Experiment 2        
        Method: 2x2x2x2: instrument typicality, picture informativeness (informative: showing instrument, uninformative: not showing instrument), did speaker see picture before or after they read the passage, did listener see picture as speaker told story
        Prediction: if listener-need account is correct, then typicality effect should disappear if listener gets instrument information from other source (ie sees picture). if speaker-experience account is correct, effect should disappear if speaker gets information from additional source
        Results: somewhat more instrument mentions for ignorant hearers (some support for audience design). overall just big main effect of typicality. but also some support for availability-based production: more typical instruments tend to be mentioned BEFORE verb, less typical ones AFTER. this could also be a UID effect. 
                  
Conclusion: They propose a box model with a quantitative component that builds on macro-propositions. There are multiple points of possible interference, that's why the results aren't directly pro audience design or pro speaker-need. They conclude that the default is to not specify instruments and only when necessary, mention them.
                  
Problems: The model is strange. Typical box model stuff, unclear where it all comes from. Methodologically, it's not clear that the items are frequency-matched (they probably aren't), so it's hard to tell whether the effect is really due to typicality or just sth simple like frequency. Of course in this case one might argue that they should be highly co-linear, since we tend to talk more about more frequently occurring things (like knives, rather than ice-picks). However, they found precisely that more typical (and thus supposedly more frequently occurring) instruments are the ones that are ommitted more, so they should be talked about less (in these particular constructions) than less typical objects. 
        
Relation between frequency and predictability here?

abstract = {Our perception of the word is the result of combining information between several senses, such as vision, audition and proprioception. These sensory modalities use widely different frames of reference to represent the properties and locations of object. Moreover, multisensory cues come with different degrees of reliability, and the reliability of a given cue can change in different contexts. The Bayesian framework--which we describe in this review--provides an optimal solution to deal with this issue of combining cues that are not equally reliable. However, this approach does not address the issue of frames of references. We show that this problem can be solved by creating cross-modal spatial links in basis function networks. Finally, we show how the basis function approach can be combined with the Bayesian framework to yield networks that can perform optimal multisensory combination. On the basis of this theory, we argue that multisensory integration is a dialogue between sensory modalities rather that the convergence of all sensory information onto a supra-modal area.},

abstract = {Delays in sensorimotor loops have led to the proposal that reaching movements are primarily under pre-programmed control and that sensory feedback loops exert an influence only at the very end of a trajectory. The present review challenges this view. Although behavioral data suggest that a motor plan is assembled prior to the onset of movement, more recent studies have indicated that this initial plan does not unfold unaltered, but is updated continuously by internal feedback loops. These loops rely on a forward model that integrates the sensory inflow and motor outflow to evaluate the consequence of the motor commands sent to a limb, such as the arm. In such a model, the probable position and velocity of an effector can be estimated with negligible delays and even predicted in advance, thus making feedback strategies possible for fast reaching movements. The parietal lobe and cerebellum appear to play a crucial role in this process. The ability of the motor system to estimate the future state of the limb might be an evolutionary substrate for mental operations that require an estimate of sequelae in the immediate future.},

abstract = {Written by highly respected theorists in psychology and philosophy, the chapters in this book explicate and address fundamental epistemological issues involved in the problem of the relationship between the individual and the collective. Different theoretical viewpoints are presented on this relationship, as well as between the nature of rationality and morality, relativism and universalism, and enculturation and internalization. Many chapters also highlight similarities and differences between these alternative frameworks and Piaget's theory, and thus correct the misperception that Piaget had nothing to say about the social dimension of development. Other chapters focus on the implications of these debates for the important topic areas of pedagogy, moral development, and the development of social understanding in infancy and childhood. Although Piaget's theory is presented and evaluated by some of the chapters in this collection, the authors remain critical and do not shy away from revising or extending Piaget's theory whenever it is deemed necessary. Though the topic covered in this book is of fundamental importance in the social sciences, it is rarely addressed in a sustained way as it is in this collection of chapters. The book benefits social scientists interested in fundamental epistemological issues, especially as these concern the relationship between the individual and the collective, with implications for the conceptualization of morality and rationality.},

abstract = {Research on attention is concerned with selective processing of incoming sensory information. To some extent, our awareness of the world depends on what we choose to attend, not merely on the stimulation entering our senses. British psychologists have made substantial contributions to this topic in the past century. Celebrated examples include Donald Broadbent's filter theory of attention, which set the agenda for most subsequent work; and Anne Treisman's revisions of this account, and her later feature-integration theory. More recent contributions include Alan Allport's prescient emphasis on the relevance of neuroscience data, and John Duncan's integration of such data with psychological theory. An idiosyncratic but roughly chronological review of developments is presented, some practical and clinical implications are briefly sketched, and future directions suggested. One of the biggest changes in the field has been the increasing interplay between psychology and neuroscience, which promises much for the future. A related change has been the realization that selection attention is best thought of as a broad topic, encompassing a range of selective issues, rather than as a single explanatory process.},

The present research however demonstrates that the sentencing decisions of experienced legal professionals are influenced by irrelevant sentencing demands even if they are blatantly determined at random. Participating legal experts anchored their sentencing decisions on a given sentencing demand and assimilated toward it even if this demand came from an irrelevant source (Study 1), they were informed that this demand was randomly determined (Study 2), or they randomly determined this demand themselves by throwing dice (Study 3). Expertise and experience did not reduce this effect. This sentencing bias appears to be produced by a selective increase in the accessibility of arguments that are consistent with the random sentencing demand: The accessibility of incriminating arguments was higher if participants were confronted with a high rather than a low anchor (Study 4). Practical and theoretical implications of this research are discussed.},

abstract = {When a person looks at an object while exploring it with their hand, vision and touch both provide information for estimating the properties of the object. Vision frequently dominates the integrated visual-haptic percept, for example when judging size, shape or position, but in some circumstances the percept is clearly affected by haptics. Here we propose that a general principle, which minimizes variance in the final estimate, determines the degree to which vision or haptics dominates. This principle is realized by using maximum-likelihood estimation to combine the inputs. To investigate cue combination quantitatively, we first measured the variances associated with visual and haptic estimation of height. We then used these measurements to construct a maximum-likelihood integrator. This model behaved very similarly to humans in a visual-haptic task. Thus, the nervous system seems to combine visual and haptic information in a fashion that is similar to a maximum-likelihood integrator. Visual dominance occurs when the variance associated with visual estimation is lower than that associated with haptic estimation.},

Whilst some is logically consistent with all, it is often pragmatically interpreted as precluding all. In Experiments 1 and 2, we show that with pragmatically impoverished materials, sensitivity to the pragmatic implicature associated with some is apparent earlier in development than has previously been found. Amongst 8-year-old children, we observed much greater sensitivity to the implicature in pragmatically enriched contexts. Finally, in Experiment 3, we found that amongst adults, logical responses to infelicitous some statements take longer to produce than do logical responses to felicitous some statements, and that working memory capacity predicts the tendency to give logical responses to the former kind of statement. These results suggest that some adults develop the ability to inhibit a pragmatic response in favour of a logical answer. We discuss the implications of these findings for theories of pragmatic inference.},

abstract = {The time-course of representing others' perspectives is inconclusive across the currently available models of ToM processing. We report two visual-world studies investigating how knowledge about a character's basic preferences (e.g. Tom's favourite colour is pink) and higher-order desires (his wish to keep this preference secret) compete to influence online expectations about subsequent behaviour. Participants' eye movements around a visual scene were tracked while they listened to auditory narratives. While clear differences in anticipatory visual biases emerged between conditions in Experiment 1, post-hoc analyses testing the strength of the relevant biases suggested a discrepancy in the time-course of predicting appropriate referents within the different contexts. Specifically, predictions to the target emerged very early when there was no conflict between the character's basic preferences and higher-order desires, but appeared to be relatively delayed when comprehenders were provided with conflicting information about that character's desire to keep a secret. However, a second experiment demonstrated that this apparent 'cognitive cost' in inferring behaviour based on higher-order desires was in fact driven by low-level features between the context sentence and visual scene. Taken together, these results suggest that healthy adults are able to make complex higher-order ToM inferences without the need to call on costly cognitive processes. Results are discussed relative to previous accounts of ToM and language processing.},

Six experiments tested the predictions concerning optional word mention of two general approaches to language production. One approach claims that language production processes choose syntactic structures that ease the task of creating sentences, so that words are spoken opportunistically, as they are selected for production. The second approach claims that a syntactic structure is chosen that is easiest to comprehend, so that optional words like that are used to avoid temporarily ambiguous, difficult-to-comprehend sentences. In all experiments, speakers did not consistently include optional words to circumvent a temporary ambiguity, but they did omit optional words (the complementizer that) when subsequent material was either repeated (within a sentence) or prompted with a recall cue. The results suggest that speakers choose syntactic structures to permit early mention of available material and not to circumvent disruptive temporary ambiguities.},

In this experiment, speakers produced sentence structures that could include an optional that, thereby delaying the mention of a subsequent noun phrase. This subsequent noun phrase was either (1) conceptually similar to three previous noun phrases in the same sentence, leading to greater proactive interference, or (2) conceptually dissimilar, leading to less proactive interference. Speakers produced more thats (and were more disfluencies) before conceptually similar noun phrases, suggesting that retrieval difficulties during sentence production affect the syntactic structures of sentences that speakers produce.},

abstract = {Across many languages, speakers tend to produce sentences so that given (previously referred to) arguments are mentioned before new arguments; this is termed given-new ordering. We explored the nature of such given-new effects in Japanese using a procedure following Bock and Irwin (1980). Speakers encoded and then recalled canonical (e.g., okusan-ga otetsudaisan-ni purezento-o okutta, "the housewife gave the housekeeper a present") or scrambled (okusan-ga purezento-o otetsudaisan-ni okutta) dative targets when prompted by a statement-question sequence. The prompting statement established one nonsubject argument of the dative target as given, leaving the other nonsubject argument as new. Previous mention was either with lexically identical content (e.g., otetsudaisan or purezento) or with lexically distinct but nearly synonymous content (meidosan, "housemaid" or okurimono, "gift"). Results showed that speakers produced canonical or scrambled word orders so that given arguments were mentioned before new, but especially when the previous mention of the given argument occurred with lexically identical content (replicating Bock and Irwin's English effect). These results show that the production of Japanese scrambled and canonical word orders is sensitive to given versus new status (as in English), implying that given-new ordering arises at the stage of sentence production where scrambling effects are realized.},

By reanalyzing data from a syntactic priming experiment (Thothathiri {\&} Snedeker, 2008), we find that the error signal associated with a syntactic prime influences comprehenders' subsequent syntactic expectations. This follows directly from error-based implicit learning accounts of syntactic priming, but it is unexpected under accounts that consider syntactic priming a consequence of temporary increases in base-level activation. More generally, the results raise questions about the principles underlying the maintenance of implicit statistical knowledge relevant to language processing, and about possible functional motivations for syntactic priming.},

Moreover, suitable neural representations of uncertainty have been identified that could underlie such probabilistic computations. In this review, we argue that learning an internal model of the sensory environment is another key aspect of the same statistical inference procedure and thus perception and learning need to be treated jointly. We review evidence for statistically optimal learning in humans and animals, and re-evaluate possible neural representations of uncertainty based on their potential to support statistically optimal learning. We propose that spontaneous activity can have a functional role in such representations leading to a new, sampling-based, framework of how the cortex represents information and uncertainty.},

If a child could understand speakers' utterances, it would be easy to learn the meanings of individual words, and once a child knows what many words mean, it is easy to infer speakers' intended meanings. To the beginning learner, however, both individual word meanings and speakers' intentions are unknown. We describe a computational model of word learning that solves these two inference problems in parallel, rather than relying exclusively on either the inferred meanings of utterances or cross-situational word-meaning associations. We tested our model using annotated corpus data and found that it inferred pairings between words and object concepts with higher precision than comparison models. Moreover, as the result of making probabilistic inferences about speakers' intentions, our model explains a variety of behavioral phenomena described in the word-learning literature. These phenomena include mutual exclusivity, one-trial learning, cross-situational learning, the role of words in object individuation, and the use of inferred intentions to disambiguate reference.},

The phenomenon of "rule learning"--quick learning of abstract regularities from exposure to a limited set of stimuli--has become an important model system for understanding generalization in infancy. Experiments with adults and children have revealed differences in performance across domains and types of rules. To understand the representational and inferential assumptions necessary to capture this broad set of results, we introduce three ideal observer models for rule learning. Each model builds on the next, allowing us to test the consequences of individual assumptions. Model 1 learns a single rule, Model 2 learns a single rule from noisy input, and Model 3 learns multiple rules from noisy input. These models capture a wide range of experimental results--including several that have been used to argue for domain-specificity or limits on the kinds of generalizations learners can make-suggesting that these ideal observers may be a useful baseline for future work on rule learning.},

abstract = {Language use and interpretation is heavily contingent on context. But human interlocutors need not always agree what the actual context is. In game theoretic approaches to language use and interpretation, interlocutors’ beliefs about the context are the players’ beliefs about the game that they are playing. Together this entails that we need to consider cases in which interlocutors have different subjective conceptualizations of the game they are in. This paper therefore extends iterated best response reasoning, as an established model for pragmatic reasoning, to games with unawareness. This extension not only leads to more plausible context models for many communicative situations, but also to improved predictions for otherwise problematic cases and an extension of the scope of pragmatic phenomena that can be captured by game theoretic analysis.},

annote = {- review of the sentence processing literature from the garden path model perspective. case studies for demonstrating principles underlying syntactic parsing: garden paths (reanalysis), thematic roles, long-distance dependencies
        
- framing: theory of language processing has to give account of how people choose to assign structure at choice points, incrementally {\&}amp; how info of different types (syntactic vs semantic vs extralinguistic) is integrated. move from unconstrained collection of heuristics (de-emphasizing linguistic knowledge) to a set of restricted principles that have sth to say about how linguistic {\&}amp; extra-linguistic knowledge are in tegrated in online comprehension and partial structure assignment
	--{\&}gt; clear rhetoric against bever (heuristics), which i actually agree with. just the way the GP model ends up going, they also have basically a set of heuristics and assign too much weight (and in a categorical way) to linguistic principles
        
- the question: how is the information used, for what purpose, at what stage of analysis?
        
- makes the point that, because there is no debate as to whether or not different kinds of information are used, studies showing that {\&}quot;some broad type of information (syntactic, lexical, semantic, pragmatic, discourse, general world knowledge) influences some final output of the entire comprehension system are not very informative{\&}quot; because they don' allow for distinguishing between different models or theories of language comprehension, so they aren't discussed in the paper
        
- structural principles of the gp model:
	- minimal attachment (create minimal parse tree, ie fewest nodes)
	- late closure (when minimal attachment can't decide)
	--{\&}gt; this is committed to a particular phrase structure grammar?
	--{\&}gt; so are the cases that ma and lc predict correctly the {\&}quot;default{\&}quot; cases in the sense that they're the most frequent ones? ie is the prior on direct objects vs sentence complements very high, similarly are verbs usually main verbs instead of the start of a reduced relative, in PP attachment more verb phrase than noun phrase modification? then this would be another case, analogous to the SI debate, where researchers have good intuitions about the priors, but ignore the extra conditioning information (context, lexical info, etc) that will improve the fit to the data
        
- against lexical preferences influencing early stages of syntactic structure assignment. for  lexical filtering after initial structure assignment.
        
- against immediate use of discourse contraints.
        
- against parallel processing
        
- proposal of syntactic processor {\&}amp; thematic processor operating in parallel, where the thematic processor evaluates the relative plausibility of thematic frames associated with phrase head (using iscourse context/world knowledge) -{\&}gt; to deal with problem of different ease of reanalysis
        
- architectural issues: modularity of the language processor
	-  thematic processor requires interface system operating in tandem with parser proper, but the systems could be encapsulated
	- seems to be arguing that there are different subsystems for lexical access, constituent structure, thematic processor
        
- invokes simplicity argument for gp model

abstract = {Words, like musical notes, are grouped together into phrases by their rhythmic and durational properties as well as their tonal pitch. This 'prosodic phrasing' affects the understanding of sentences. Many processing studies of prosody have investigated sentences with a single, grammatically required prosodic boundary, which might be interpreted strictly locally, as a signal to end the current syntactic unit. Recent results suggest, however, that the global pattern of prosodic phrasing is what matters in sentence comprehension, not just the occurrence or size of a single local boundary. In this article we claim that the impact of prosodic boundaries depends on the other prosodic choices a speaker has made. We speculate that prosody serves to hold distinct linguistic representations together in memory.},

abstract = {Four experiments used the psychological refractory period logic to examine whether integration of multiple sources of phonemic information has a decisional locus. All experiments made use of a dual-task paradigm in which participants made forced-choice color categorization (Task 1) and phoneme categorization (Task 2) decisions at varying stimulus onset asynchronies. In Experiment 1, Task 2 difficulty was manipulated using words containing matching or mismatching coarticulatory cues to the final consonant. The results showed that difficulty and onset asynchrony combined in an underadditive way, suggesting that the phonemic mismatch was resolved prior to a central decisional bottleneck. Similar results were found in Experiment 2 using nonwords. In Experiment 3, the manipulation of task difficulty involved lexical status, which once again revealed an underadditive pattern of response times. Finally, Experiment 4 compared this prebottleneck variable with a decisional variable: response key bias. The latter showed an additive pattern of responses. The experiments show that resolution of phonemic ambiguity can take advantage of cognitive slack time at short asynchronies, indicating that phonemic integration takes place at a relatively early stage of spoken word recognition.},

abstract = {Idiomatic phrases differ in their degree of analyzability. Some idioms are highly decomposable with the meanings of their parts contributing independently to their overall figurative meanings (e.g., pop the question can be decomposed into pop meaning “suddenly make” and the question referring to “a marriage proposal”). Other idioms are nondecomposable because it is difficult to see any relation between a phrase's individual components and the idiom's figurative meaning (e.g., the parts of kick the bucket do not independently contribute to the figurative meaning of the phrase “to die”). The present studies investigated the role of analyzability or semantic decomposition in idiom processing. We expected that nondecomposable idioms should be processed more quickly than decomposable phrases because expressions such as kick the bucket are lexicalized and should be easier to access from the mental lexicon. However, Experiment 1 showed that nondecomposable idioms were processed more slowly than analyzable idiom phrases. Experiment 2 and 3 indicated that previous research demonstrating a processing advantage for syntactically frozen idioms was due to their degree of semantic decomposition. The results of these experiments suggest that idioms are initially processed in a compositional manner similar to understanding of more literal language. However, people still do not necessarily analyze the literal meanings of idioms during understanding of these figurative phrases.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a new theory of the relationship between the sentence processing mechanism and the available computational resources. This theory-the Syntactic Prediction Locality Theory (SPLT)-has two components: an integration cost component and a component for the memory cost associated with keeping track of obligatory syntactic requirements. Memory cost is hypothesized to be quantified in terms of the number of syntactic categories that are necessary to complete the current input string as a grammatical sentence. Furthermore, in accordance with results from the working memory literature both memory cost and integration cost are hypothesized to be heavily influenced by locality (1) the longer a predicted category must be kept in memory before the prediction is satisfied, the greater is the cost for maintaining that prediction; and (2) the greater the distance between an incoming word and the most local head or dependent to which it attaches, the greater the integration cost. The SPLT is shown to explain a wide range of processing complexity phenomena not previously accounted for under a single theory, including (1) the lower complexity of subject-extracted relative clauses compared to object-extracted relative clauses, (2) numerous processing overload effects across languages, including the unacceptability of multiply center-embedded structures, (3) the lower complexity of cross-serial dependencies relative to center-embedded dependencies, (4) heaviness effects, such that sentences are easier to understand when larger phrases are placed later and (5) numerous ambiguity effects, such as those which have been argued to be evidence for the Active Filler Hypothesis.},

abstract = {Sentence processing theories typically assume that the input to our language processing mechanisms is an error-free sequence of words. However, this assumption is an oversimplification because noise is present in typical language use (for instance, due to a noisy environment, producer errors, or perceiver errors). A complete theory of human sentence comprehension therefore needs to explain how humans understand language given imperfect input. Indeed, like many cognitive systems, language processing mechanisms may even be "well designed"--in this case for the task of recovering intended meaning from noisy utterances. In particular, comprehension mechanisms may be sensitive to the types of information that an idealized statistical comprehender would be sensitive to. Here, we evaluate four predictions about such a rational (Bayesian) noisy-channel language comprehender in a sentence comprehension task: (i) semantic cues should pull sentence interpretation towards plausible meanings, especially if the wording of the more plausible meaning is close to the observed utterance in terms of the number of edits; (ii) this process should asymmetrically treat insertions and deletions due to the Bayesian "size principle"; such nonliteral interpretation of sentences should (iii) increase with the perceived noise rate of the communicative situation and (iv) decrease if semantically anomalous meanings are more likely to be communicated. These predictions are borne out, strongly suggesting that human language relies on rational statistical inference over a noisy channel.},

This paper surveys the evidence for four types of constraints on sentence comprehension: (1) lexical constraints, (2) contextual constraints, (3) locality-based computational resource constraints, and (4) phrase-level contingent frequency constraints. These four constraints, in combination with grammatical phrase-formation information and prosody, are sufficient to explain how interpretations are constructed for sentences as they are encountered, including complexity effects in unambiguous sentences and interpretation preferences in ambiguous sentences.},

abstract = {A well-established principle of language is that there is a preference for closely related words to be close together in the sentence. This can be expressed as a preference for dependency length minimization (DLM). In this study, we explore quantitatively the degree to which natural languages reflect DLM. We extract the dependencies from natural language text and reorder the words in such a way as to minimize dependency length. Comparing the original text with these optimal linearizations (and also with random linearizations) reveals the degree to which natural language minimizes dependency length. Tests on English data show that English shows a strong effect of DLM, with dependency length much closer to optimal than to random; the optimal English grammar also has many specific features in common with English. In German, too, dependency length is significantly less than random, but the effect is much weaker than in English. We conclude by speculating about some possible reasons for this difference between English and German.},

It has been argued that gestures lighten the load on verbal working memory (VWM; Goldin-Meadow, Nusbaum, Kelly, {\&} Wagner, 2001), but gestures have also been argued to aid in lexical retrieval (Krauss, 1998). In the current study, 50 speakers completed an individual differences battery that included measures of VWM and lexical retrieval. To elicit gesture, each speaker described short cartoon clips immediately after viewing. Measures of lexical retrieval did not predict spontaneous gesture rates, but lower VWM was associated with higher gesture rates, suggesting that gestures can facilitate language production by supporting VWM when resources are taxed. These data also suggest that individual variability in the propensity to gesture is partly linked to cognitive capacities. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Experiment 1 presented participants with scenes designed to elicit the use of a perspective predicate (The man chases the dog/The dog flees from the man) or a conjoined noun phrase sentential Subject (A cat and a dog/A dog and a cat). Gaze was directed to a particular scene character by way of an attention-capture manipulation. Attention capture increased the likelihood that this character would be the sentential Subject and altered the choice of perspective verb or word order within conjoined NP Subjects accordingly. Experiment 2 extended these results to word order choice within Active versus Passive structures (The girl is kicking the boy/The boy is being kicked by the girl) and symmetrical predicates (The girl is meeting the boy/The boy is meeting the girl). Experiment 2 also found that early endogenous shifts in attention influence word order choices. These findings indicate a reliable relationship between initial looking patterns and speaking patterns, reflecting considerable parallelism between the on-line apprehension of events and the on-line construction of descriptive utterances.},

abstract = {Work in philosophy and psychology has argued for a dissociation between perceptually-based similarity and higher-level rules in conceptual thought. Although such a dissociation may be justified at times, our goal is to illustrate ways in which conceptual processing is grounded in perception, both for perceptual similarity and abstract rules. We discuss the advantages, power and influences of perceptually-based representations. First, many of the properties associated with amodal symbol systems can be achieved with perceptually-based systems as well (e.g. productivity). Second, relatively raw perceptual representations are powerful because they can implicitly represent properties in an analog fashion. Third, perception naturally provides impressions of overall similarity, exactly the type of similarity useful for establishing many common categories. Fourth, perceptual similarity is not static but becomes tuned over time to conceptual demands. Fifth, the original motivation or basis for sophisticated cognition is often less sophisticated perceptual similarity. Sixth, perceptual simulation occurs even in conceptual tasks that have no explicit perceptual demands. Parallels between perceptual and conceptual processes suggest that many mechanisms typically associated with abstract thought are also present in perception, and that perceptual processes provide useful mechanisms that may be co-opted by abstract thought.},

The CHILDES database provides estimates of frequency with which parents use these words with their children (age: 0 ; 7-7 ; 5; mean age: 36 months). For production, across all words higher parental frequency is associated with later acquisition. Within lexical categories, however, higher frequency is related to earlier acquisition. For comprehension, parental frequency correlates significantly with the age of acquisition only for common nouns. Frequency effects change with development. Thus, frequency impacts vocabulary acquisition in a complex interaction with category, modality and developmental stage.},

To help evaluate this view, we can formalize it as the rational speech-act theory: Listeners assume that speakers choose their utterances approximately optimally, and listeners interpret an utterance by using Bayesian inference to "invert" this model of the speaker. We apply this framework to model scalar implicature ("some" implies "not all," and "N" implies "not more than N"). This model predicts an interaction between the speaker's knowledge state and the listener's interpretation. We test these predictions in two experiments and find good fit between model predictions and human judgments.},
annote = {on this one and Frank {\&}amp; Goodman 2012:

These papers are part of a more general push towards developing probabilistic models of pragmatic inference. The big ones have come from Amsterdam/Berlin/Tubingen (game-theoretic models that treat communicative settings as signaling games, rely on Bayesian update and iterated reasoning), the MIT/Stanford crowd around Mike Frank and Noah Goodman (Bayesian models that assume the listener has model of informative speaker), and more recently Ben Russell's thesis, where he derives implicatures probabilistically from a pretty complex theory of utterance interpretation.

Gricean Quantity reasoning:
1. The speaker could have produced the stronger alternative, which would have also been RELEVANT and more INFORMATIVE. 
2. If the speaker KNEW that the stronger alternative holds, she would have used the stronger alternative
3. The speaker is well-informed and HONEST
4. Thus the stronger alternative must not hold

Commonalities:
- pragmatic inference as social cognition: what other things could the speaker have said/done given what he knows
- assume that listeners have a model of the speaker, which in turn is assumed to be maximally informative given the literal meaning of utterances
- listeners then choose actions (interpretations) in proportion to the probability with which the speaker would have produced a particular utterance in a particular situation


Differences:
- 2012: referential expressions; assume full speaker access
- 2013: quantified statements; model limited access situations

Open issue:
- RELEVANCE of alterantives; QUD; how are alternatives generated},

We explore the relative learning speeds of abstract and specific knowledge within a Bayesian framework and the role for innate structure. We focus on knowledge about causality, seen as a domain-general intuitive theory, and ask whether this knowledge can be learned from co-occurrence of events. We begin by phrasing the causal Bayes nets theory of causality and a range of alternatives in a logical language for relational theories. This allows us to explore simultaneous inductive learning of an abstract theory of causality and a causal model for each of several causal systems. We find that the correct theory of causality can be learned relatively quickly, often becoming available before specific causal theories have been learned--an effect we term the blessing of abstraction. We then explore the effect of providing a variety of auxiliary evidence and find that a collection of simple perceptual input analyzers can help to bootstrap abstract knowledge. Together, these results suggest that the most efficient route to causal knowledge may be to build in not an abstract notion of causality but a powerful inductive learning mechanism and a variety of perceptual supports. While these results are purely computational, they have implications for cognitive development, which we explore in the conclusion.},

abstract = {When referring to named objects, speakers can choose either a name (mbira) or a description (that gourd-like instrument with metal strips); whether the name provides useful information depends on whether the speaker's knowledge of the name is shared with the addressee. But, how do speakers determine what is shared? In 2 experiments a na{\"{\i}}ve participant (director) learned names for novel objects, then instructed another participant (matcher), who viewed 3 objects, to click on the target object. Directors learned novel names in 2 phases. First, the director and the matcher learned (shared) names either together or alone; second, the director learned (privileged) names alone. Directors typically used a name for items with shared names and a description for items with privileged names. When the director and matcher learned the names individually but with knowledge of what the other learned, directors were much more likely to use privileged names than when director and matcher learned shared names together. Experiment 1b separated effects of collaborative learning from partner-specific effects, showing collaborative learning experience with 1 person helps a speaker distinguish shared and privileged information with a new partner who has the same knowledge. Experiment 2 showed that partner-specific effects persisted even when semantic category was a reliable cue to which names were privileged. The results are interpreted as evidence that ordinary memory processes provide access to shared knowledge in real-time production of referring expressions and that shared experience when learning shared names provides a strong memory cue to the ground status of names.

What are the conditions that govern conversation? (In reaction to pure formalists.)

- distinction between what is said (sentence meaning) vs what is meant (speaker meaning) 
- hierarchy of meaning (total signification of an utterance, said/meant, implicated -{\&}gt; conventionally/conversationally, conversational implicature-{\&}gt; genearlized/particularized)

- conventional: consequence of expression's conventional meaning, not guided by rational principles of language use. not part of the truth conditions.

- conversational: arising from the cooperative principle. mutual assumption of rationality. different maxims guide different aspects of utterance choice:
- information conveyed: Quantity, Quality, Relevance
- form of information conveyed: Manner

- different ways to disobey maxims:
- violation. bad gricean behavior.
- opting out. make clear that your further behavior cannot be considered fully gricean.
- clash...
- flouting. get implicature by exploiting maxims. 

- GCI-PCI
- GCI: implicature arises unless blocked by context
- PCI: implicature arises in virtue of special fetaures of the context

- examples of different maxims:
- Quantity: south of france; good party? some friends.; letter of recommendation; indefinites
- Quality: irony, metaphor, meiosis, hyperbole
- Relevance: skiing example-{\&}gt; yes/no
- Manner: c-h-o-c-o-l-a-t-e, and

- features of conversational implicature: non-conventionality, calculability, non-detachability, cancelability, reinforceability (levinson), universality (levinson)

abstract = {Cognitive science aims to reverse-engineer the mind, and many of the engineering challenges the mind faces involve induction. The probabilistic approach to modeling cognition begins by identifying ideal solutions to these inductive problems. Mental processes are then modeled using algorithms for approximating these solutions, and neural processes are viewed as mechanisms for implementing these algorithms, with the result being a top-down analysis of cognition starting with the function of cognitive processes. Typical connectionist models, by contrast, follow a bottom-up approach, beginning with a characterization of neural mechanisms and exploring what macro-level functional phenomena might emerge. We argue that the top-down approach yields greater flexibility for exploring the representations and inductive biases that underlie human cognition.},
annote = {- overview of probabilistic approach to modeling cognition
        
- assumption that many of the problem faced by the mind are induction problems
        
- enterprise of reverse-engineering the mind in the Bayesian framework involves 3 steps:
	1. computational level: identify ideal solutions to induction problems
	2. algorithmic level: develop algorithms for approximating solutions derived in 1.
	3. implementational level: neural processes as implementing algorithms in 2.
        
- in contrast: connectionist models follow bottom-up approach. characterize neural mechanisms and figure out what functional phenomena might emerge.
	- of course they think the top-down approach is better.
	- they say connectionism often goes together with a philosophy of emergentism/eliminativism -{\&}gt; higher-level explanations are at best an approximation to mechanistic truth
	- assumptions of connectionism: graded representations, defined in vector spaces, lacking explicit structure, shaped almost exclusively by experience through error-driven learning algorithms (eg backpropagation)
        
- probabilistic models as top-down/function-first strategies
	--{\&}gt; it's not clear to me why the two need to be completely independent. seems like connectionist implementations could be useful for probabilistic models, and then you're just arguing about which level is more important, which seems silly. UPDATE: right. see conclusion, they themselves use the bridge built from different ends metaphor
        
- power of probabilistic models: offer solutions to inductive problems (most of cognition - acquiring language, concept, causal model - requires uncertain inference from partial/noisy information)
        
- in contrast to connectionism, Bayesian prob models allow for structured representations at different levels and combine those with statistical learning {\&}amp; inference
	- recipe: rational analysis steps 1-6
	- hypotheses can take any form: weights in neural network, structured symbolic representations, etc. - only requirement: specify a probability distribution over observable data
		--{\&}gt; no a priori commitment to any particular representations, but actually provides a framework for evaluating different proposals
	- models can be defined over eg causal graphs, phrase structure grammars, logical rules, theories, etc
        
- survey of probabilistic models in variety of domains
	- rapid {\&}amp; flexible generalization
		- p. models can explain eg word learning, property  induction, causal learning as bayesian inference
		- can explain individual difference (different priors or knowledge representations)
		- algorithmic-level explanations can explain HOW, but not WHY certain behaviors arise. BR can explain the WHY.
	- causal learning
		- BR provides distinction between structure (of causal relation) and strength (of that relation)
	- language learning
		- BR can evaluate different hypotheses about availability of structures at different stages of language learning, can combine different sources of data
	- visual perception
	- learning to learn
        
- interpretation of probabilistic models on lower levels of analysis ({\&}amp; problems commonly raised)
	- problems: 
	1. bayesian models are implausible as accounts of human cognition because 
	a) Bayesian inference is computationally intractable and 
	(answer: approximate inference. eg gradient-descent learning like backpropagation. can be implemented in neural network. or monte carlo methods where prob distribution is approximated with a set of samples from that distribution (eg importance sampling, particle filters))
	b) the hypothesis space has to be specified in advance
	(answer: same criticism applies to connectionists, but they don't make it explicit. also, presupposes that comp-level analysis requires algorithmic level analysis to take same form, but that's not true.)
        
- conclusion: bottom-up or top-down? -{\&}gt; building bridge from separate ends metaphor
	- both important, but bottom-up doesn't answer the WHY question
	- bottom-up approaches might be very sensitive to details of underlying mechanisms, which are often either unknown or abstracted away from, so consequences unclear {\&}amp; might strongly influence resulting emergent behavior.
		--{\&}gt; this stands in interesting opposition to the criticism of connectionists that rational analysis faces the problem of mis-characterizing the problem that a system needs to solve (Chomsky example). seems like the same criticism but at different levels},

@article{Grodner2010,
abstract = {Scalar inferences are commonly generated when a speaker uses a weaker expression rather than a stronger alternative, e.g., John ate some of the apples implies that he did not eat them all. This article describes a visual-world study investigating how and when perceivers compute these inferences. Participants followed spoken instructions containing the scalar quantifier some directing them to interact with one of several referential targets (e.g., Click on the girl who has some of the balloons). Participants fixated on the target compatible with the implicated meaning of some and avoided a competitor compatible with the literal meaning prior to a disambiguating noun. Further, convergence on the target was as fast for some as for the non-scalar quantifiers none and all. These findings indicate that the scalar inference is computed immediately and is not delayed relative to the literal interpretation of some. It is argued that previous demonstrations that scalar inferences increase processing time are not necessarily due to delays in generating the inference itself, but rather arise because integrating the interpretation of the inference with relevant information in the context may require additional time. With sufficient contextual support, processing delays disappear.},

abstract = {A central and influential idea among researchers of language is that our language faculty is organized according to Fregean compositionality, which states that the meaning of an utterance is a function of the meaning of its parts and of the syntactic rules by which these parts are combined. Since the domain of syntactic rules is the sentence, the implication of this idea is that language interpretation takes place in a two-step fashion. First, the meaning of a sentence is computed. In a second step, the sentence meaning is integrated with information from prior discourse, world knowledge, information about the speaker and semantic information from extra-linguistic domains such as co-speech gestures or the visual world. Here, we present results from recordings of event-related brain potentials that are inconsistent with this classical two-step model of language interpretation. Our data support a one-step model in which knowledge about the context and the world, concomitant information from other modalities, and the speaker are brought to bear immediately, by the same fast-acting brain system that combines the meanings of individual words into a message-level representation. Underlying the one-step model is the immediacy assumption, according to which all available information will immediately be used to co-determine the interpretation of the speaker's message. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data that we collected indicate that Broca's area plays an important role in semantic unification. Language comprehension involves the rapid incorporation of information in a 'single unification space', coming from a broader range of cognitive domains than presupposed in the standard two-step model of interpretation.},

- argue against the traditional 2-stage view of utterance interpretation via Fregean compositionality (integration af pragmatic context after computing semantics). instead, present ERP evidence for what they call the {\&}quot;immediacy assumption{\&}quot;
	--{\&}gt; immediacy assumption: akin to contraint-based approach, assume that all info is integrated as it becomes available, incrementally
        
- 2-stage models:
	- their birdseye view of 2-stage models: first compute context-free meaning by combining lexical semantics in tandem with syntax. then integrate with info from prior discourse, world knowldge, info about speaker {\&}amp; semantic info from other modalities
	- of cutler {\&}amp; clifton 1999: first utterance interpretation, then integration into discourse model
	- of lattner {\&}amp; friederici 2003: mismatches between spoken message and speaker are detected late. slow pragmatic computations are different from rapid semantic computations in which word meanings are combined
        
- 1-stage models (making the {\&}quot;immediacty assumption{\&}quot;): just {\&}amp; carpnter, crain, steedman, garrod, sanford, macdonald, tanenhaus, trueswell, clark, altmann, van berkum, jackendofff (really?), zwaan
        
- present empirical evdience (mostly from ERPs and some from fMRI) for 1-stage models
	- use N400 component, which is modulated not only by semantic mismatch: also modulated by 
	- subtle difference in semantic expectation
	- discourse incoherence
	- {\&}quot;The peanut was salted/in love{\&}quot;, britney spears (male/female), tattoo (upper/lower-class), wine (child adult): n400 for unexpected version. but all of these are unexpected wrt discourse expectations/world knowledge, NOT semantics (actually inverted in the peanut case). so pragmatic info integrated as quickly as semantic info 
	- {\&}quot;the dutch trains are sour/white/yellow and very crowded{\&}quot; -{\&}gt; sour/white both give rise to n400, yellow doesn't. evidence that both selectional restrictions and 
        
--{\&}gt; they make the weird claim that unlike eye movements, ERPs provide {\&}quot;clear cues{\&}quot; to the processes involved because you can tell whether or not 2 sources of info are recruited by the same neuronal system
	- first of all, there's the source problem, so you don't actually know whether 2 sources of info are recruited by the same neuronal system
	- second of all, even if they are, that doesn't mean that they're FUNCTIONALLY the same system. activation of the same brain area does not mean that the same neurons are processing the available  information. could be distinct processes
        
        
--{\&}gt; fregean compositionality is kind of a strange thing to argue against from a processing view because it's not intended to be a processing theory. yet they cite people like grice, fodoer, sperber {\&}amp; wilson, cutler {\&}amp; clifton, alttner {\&}amp; friederici as proposing 2-stage model. 
	- of these, at least grice did not intend to make any processing claims
	- sperber {\&}amp; wilson would say that the pragmatics somehow helps {\&}quot;fill out{\&}quot; the gaps in the semantics
	- taking the rest at face value, not surprising that from a processing perspective cliften {\&}amp; friederici would be dumb enough to propose 2-stage model
        
--{\&}gt; has anyone ever tried correlating N400 amplitude size with information content of the word it's in response to? i mean, every word gives rise to an N400, except that it's only ever studied in cases where it's really big. but couldn't you in principle have people read text, then calculate average N400 amplitude for each word and correlate that with the information content of that word in context? seems like that has the potential for capturing a bunch of findings (N400 in response to semantic anomaly (selectional restriction violations etc) and discourse incoherence. though this would not be able to caputre effects like voice-based inconsistences (male/female)

abstract = {Classical informal reasoning "fallacies," for example, begging the question or arguing from ignorance, while ubiquitous in everyday argumentation, have been subject to little systematic investigation in cognitive psychology. In this article it is argued that these "fallacies" provide a rich taxonomy of argument forms that can be differentially strong, dependent on their content. A Bayesian theory of content-dependent argument strength is presented. Possible psychological mechanisms are identified. Experiments are presented investigating whether people's judgments of the strength of 3 fallacies--the argumentum ad ignorantiam, the circular argument or petitio principii, and the slippery slope argument--are affected by the factors a Bayesian account predicts.

abstract = {This study provides a numerical representation of contextual effects on the meanings of words, constructed from the order judgments of 19 subjects concerning the word "red" in 19 sentences. Subjects judged whether or not the red object mentioned in a sentence was redder than, less red than, or could be equally as red as the red object mentioned in each of the other sentences. These judgments were well described as an interval order. This means that the red ascribed in a sentence can be represented by a real interval with judgments of equally red corresponding to overlapping intervals. Semiorder axioms were not met, indicating that the width of the interval varied from sentence to sentence. Possible ways of incorporating the result into theories of semantic memory were discussed, as well as ways of accounting for the pronounced individual differences which were observed. The research described herein was supported by the National Institute of Education under Contract HEW NIE-G-74-0007.},

The authors addressed this long-standing debate by examining how a large-scale computational model based on connectionist principles would solve the problem and comparing the model's performance to people's. In contrast to previous models, the present model uses an architecture in which meanings are jointly determined by the 2 components, with the division of labor between them affected by the nature of the mappings between codes. The model is consistent with a variety of behavioral phenomena, including the results of studies of homophones and pseudohomophones thought to support other theories, and illustrates how efficient processing can be achieved using multiple simultaneous constraints.},

We suggest how current developments in linguistics can be profitably wedded to work in evolutionary biology, anthropology, psychology, and neuroscience. We submit that a distinction should be made between the faculty of language in the broad sense (FLB) and in the narrow sense (FLN). FLB includes a sensory-motor system, a conceptual-intentional system, and the computational mechanisms for recursion, providing the capacity to generate an infinite range of expressions from a finite set of elements. We hypothesize that FLN only includes recursion and is the only uniquely human component of the faculty of language. We further argue that FLN may have evolved for reasons other than language, hence comparative studies might look for evidence of such computations outside of the domain of communication (for example, number, navigation, and social relations).},

abstract = {This article argues against Manner–Place–Time and other proposed grammatical principles of ordering for prepositional phrases (PPs) in postverbal position in English. Instead, greater empirical adequacy can be achieved by a theory of processing efficiency that defines a preference for minimal domains in the recognition of syntactic phrase structure and in the processing of lexical–semantic dependencies between verbs and prepositions. Some new entailment tests are proposed on the basis of which these dependencies can be defined. The data come from 500 pages of written English. For 300 pages, an additional analysis is given in terms of structural ambiguity avoidance and pragmatic information status. Syntactic complexity is the biggest single predictor of PP sequences, whereas lexical–semantic factors predominate when syntactic preferences are weak. Manner–Place–Time is not the correct semantic generalization, however. Ambiguity avoidance had no clear impact on these orderings. Pragmatic effects were not visible when syntactic weight made no predictions and were correlated with weight when it did but were less strongly supported.},

The second has been the recognition of the role of internal reward in guiding eye and body movements, revealed especially in neurophysiological studies.

abstract = {Many tasks can be carried out by using several sources of information. For example, an object's size and shape can be judged based on visual as well as haptic cues. It has been shown recently that human observers integrate visual and haptic size information in a statistically optimal fashion, in the sense that the integrated estimate is most reliable (Ernst and Banks in Nature 415:429-433, 2002). In the present study, we tested whether this holds also for visual and haptic shape information. In previous studies virtual stimuli were used to test for optimality in integration. Virtual displays may, however, contain additional inappropriate cues that provide conflicting information and thus affect cue integration. Therefore, we studied optimal integration using real objects. Furthermore, we presented visual information via mirrors to create a spatial separation between visual and haptic cues while observers saw their hand touching the object and thus, knew that they were seeing and feeling the same object. Does this knowledge promote integration even though signals are spatially discrepant which has been shown to lead to a breakdown of integration (Gepshtein et al. in J Vis 5:1013-1023, 2005)? Consistent with the model predictions, observers weighted visual and haptic cues to shape according to their reliability: progressively more weight was given to haptics when visual information became less reliable. Moreover, the integrated visual-haptic estimate was more reliable than either unimodal estimate. These findings suggest that observers integrate visual and haptic shape information of real 3D objects. Thereby, knowledge that multisensory signals arise from the same object seems to promote integration.},

However, whether Alzheimer's disease (AD), in which the brain damage is more widespread, affects semantic categories to a different extent is still controversial. In the present study, we assess this issue by means of the semantic priming technique. AD patients with a mild impairment of their semantic knowledge showed comparable priming effects to that of controls for the categories of animals and artifacts. Interestingly, however, patients with a moderate impairment of their semantic knowledge showed a normal priming effect for animals but a very reduced priming effect (if any) for artifacts. These results reveal that AD may affect the semantic knowledge of different semantic categories to a different extent. The implications of this observation for current theoretical accounts of semantic representation in the brain are discussed.},

abstract = {The projected pattern of retinal-image motion supplies the human visual system with valuable information about properties of the three-dimensional environment. How well three-dimensional properties can be recovered depends both on the accuracy with which the early motion system estimates retinal motion, and on the way later processes interpret this retinal motion. Here we combine both early and late stages of the computational process to account for the hitherto puzzling phenomenon of systematic biases in three-dimensional shape perception. We present data showing how the perceived depth of a hinged plane ('an open book') can be systematically biased by the extent over which it rotates. We then present a Bayesian model that combines early measurement noise with geometric reconstruction of the three-dimensional scene. Although this model has no in-built bias towards particular three-dimensional shapes, it accounts for the data well. Our analysis suggests that the biases stem largely from the geometric constraints imposed on what three-dimensional scenes are compatible with the (noisy) early motion measurements. Given these findings, we suggest that the visual system may act as an optimal estimator of three-dimensional structure-from-motion.},

abstract = {Scalar implicature has served as a test case for exploring the relations between semantic and pragmatic processes during language comprehension. Most studies have used reaction time methods and the results have been variable. In these studies, we use the visual-world paradigm to investigate implicature. We recorded participants' eye movements during commands like "Point to the girl that has some of the socks" in the presence of a display in which one girl had two of four socks and another had three of three soccer balls. These utterances contained an initial period of ambiguity in which the semantics of some was compatible with both characters. This ambiguity could be immediately resolved by a pragmatic implicature which would restrict some to a proper subset. Instead in Experiments 1 and 2, we found that participants were substantially delayed, suggesting a lag between semantic and pragmatic processing. In Experiment 3, we examined interpretations of some when competitors were inconsistent with the semantics (girl with socks vs. girl with no socks). We found quick resolution of the target, suggesting that previous delays were specifically linked to pragmatic analysis.},

abstract = {Recent research on children's inferencing has found that although adults typically adopt the pragmatic interpretation of some (implying not all), 5- to 9-year-olds often prefer the semantic interpretation of the quantifier (meaning possibly all). Do these failures reflect a breakdown of pragmatic competence or the metalinguistic demands of prior tasks? In 3 experiments, the authors used the visual-world eye-tracking paradigm to elicit an implicit measure of adults' and children's abilities to generate scalar implicatures. Although adults' eye-movements indicated that adults had interpreted some with the pragmatic inference, children's looks suggested that children persistently interpreted some as compatible with all (Experiment 1). Nevertheless, both adults and children were able to quickly reject competitors that were inconsistent with the semantics of some; this confirmed the sensitivity of the paradigm (Experiment 2). Finally, adults, but not children, successfully distinguished between situations that violated the scalar implicature and those that did not (Experiment 3). These data demonstrate that children interpret quantifiers on the basis of their semantic content and fail to generate scalar implicatures during online language comprehension.},

abstract = {Within the framework of Conceptual Semantics, a family of conceptual features and functions is developed that accounts for phenomena in the semantics of noun phrases such as the mass-count distinction, plurality, the partitive construction (a leg of the table), the constitutive construction (a house of wood), the "Universal Packager" (three coffees), and boundary words such as end, edge, and crust. Using the strong formal parallelism between noun phrase semantics and event structure that is a hallmark of the Conceptual Semantics approach, the features and functions of the NP system are applied to a wide range of problems in event structure, for example the analysis of the Vendler classes, the meaning of the progressive, the "imperfective paradox", and "aktionsarten" such as the syntactically unexpressed sense of repetition in The light flashed until dawn. Crucial to the analysis is that these features and functions can be expressed in syntactic structure either by being part of lexical conceptual structure, or by use of a morphological affix, or by being associated with the meaning of a construction such as N of NP or nominal compounding. Alternatively, they may remain unexpressed altogether, being introduced into the conceptual structure of a phrase by "rules of construal". This shows that lexical semantics and phrasal semantics interpenetrate deeply, and that there is no strict one-to-one correspondence between syntactic and semantic structures. In addition, the analysis provides further evidence that natural language semantics must be based on a psychological view of meaning--it must be concerned with how language users are constructed to understand and schematize the world.},

This prediction is tested against data from syntactic reduction. A single multilevel logit model analysis of naturally distributed data from a corpus of spontaneous speech is used to assess the effect of information density on complementizer that-mentioning, while simultaneously evaluating the predictions of several influential alternative accounts: availability, ambiguity avoidance, and dependency processing accounts. Information density emerges as an important predictor of speakers' preferences during production. As information is defined in terms of probabilities, it follows that production is probability-sensitive, in that speakers' preferences are affected by the contextual probability of syntactic structures. The merits of a corpus-based approach to the study of language production are discussed as well.},

abstract = {This paper identifies several serious problems with the widespread use of ANOVAs for the analysis of categorical outcome variables such as forced-choice variables, question-answer accuracy, choice in production (e.g. in syntactic priming research), et cetera. I show that even after applying the arcsine-square-root transformation to proportional data, ANOVA can yield spurious results. I discuss conceptual issues underlying these problems and alternatives provided by modern statistics. Specifically, I introduce ordinary logit models (i.e. logistic regression), which are well-suited to analyze categorical data and offer many advantages over ANOVA. Unfortunately, ordinary logit models do not include random effect modeling. To address this issue, I describe mixed logit models (Generalized Linear Mixed Models for binomially distributed outcomes, Breslow {\&} Clayton, 1993), which combine the advantages of ordinary logit models with the ability to account for random subject and item effects in one step of analysis. Throughout the paper, I use a psycholinguistic data set to compare the different statistical methods.},

@article{Jaeger2013a,
abstract = {Speakers show a remarkable tendency to align their productions with their interlocutors'. Focusing on sentence production, we investigate the cognitive systems underlying such alignment (syntactic priming). Our guiding hypothesis is that syntactic priming is a consequence of a language processing system that is organized to achieve efficient communication in an ever-changing (subjectively non-stationary) environment. We build on recent work suggesting that comprehenders adapt to the statistics of the current environment. If such adaptation is rational or near-rational, the extent to which speakers adapt their expectations for a syntactic structure after processing a prime sentence should be sensitive to the prediction error experienced while processing the prime. This prediction is shared by certain error-based implicit learning accounts, but not by most other accounts of syntactic priming. In three studies, we test this prediction against data from conversational speech, speech during picture description, and written production during sentence completion. All three studies find stronger syntactic priming for primes associated with a larger prediction error (primes with higher syntactic surprisal). We find that the relevant prediction error is sensitive to both prior and recent experience within the experiment. Together with other findings, this supports accounts that attribute syntactic priming to expectation adaptation. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Concepts of objects as enduring and complete across space and time have been documented in infants within several months after birth, but little is known about how such concepts arise during development. Current theories that stress innate knowledge may neglect the potential contributions of experience to guide acquisition of object concepts. To examine whether learning plays an important role in early development of object representations, we used an eye-tracking paradigm with 4- and 6-month-old infants who were provided with an initial period of experience viewing an unoccluded trajectory, or no experience with this particular stimulus. After exposure to the unoccluded trajectory for only 2 min, there was a reliable increase in 4-month-old infants' anticipatory eye movement when the infants subsequently viewed occluded-trajectory displays, relative to 4-month-old infants who did not receive this experience. This effect of training in 4-month-old infants was found to generalize to another category of trajectory orientation. Older infants received no additional benefit from training, most likely because they enter the task capable of forming robust object representations under these conditions. This finding provides compelling evidence that very brief training facilitated formation of object representations, and suggests more generally that infants learn such representations from real-world experience viewing objects undergoing occlusion and disocclusion.},

abstract = {In recent years, some researchers have proposed that a fundamental component of the word recognition process is that each fovea is divided precisely at its vertical midline and that information either side of this midline projects to different, contralateral hemispheres. Thus, when a word is fixated, all letters to the left of the point of fixation project only to the right hemisphere whereas all letters to the right of the point of fixation project only to the left hemisphere. An informed assessment of research in this area requires an accurate understanding of the nature of the evidence and arguments that have been used to develop this "split-fovea theory" of word recognition (SFT). The purpose of this article is to facilitate this understanding by assessing recent published support for SFT. In particular, we assess (i) the precision with which experiments have been conducted, (ii) the assumptions made about human visual ability, and (iii) the accuracy with which earlier research has been reported. The assessment reveals shortcomings and errors that are likely to impact on an accurate understanding of research in this area and, therefore, on an accurate understanding of the viability of SFT.},

abstract = {The sequential acquisition of visual information from scenes is a fundamental component of natural visually guided behavior. However, little is known about the control mechanisms responsible for the eye movement sequences that are executed in the service of such behavior. Theoretical attempts to explain gaze patterns have almost exclusively concerned two-dimensional displays that do not accurately reflect the demands of natural behavior in dynamic environments or the importance of the observer's behavioral goals. A difficult problem for all models of gaze control, intrinsic to selective perceptual systems, is how to detect important but unexpected stimuli without consuming excessive computational resources. We show, in a real walking environment, that human gaze patterns are remarkably sensitive to the probabilistic structure of the environment, suggesting that observers handle the uncertainty of the natural world by proactively allocating gaze on the basis of learned statistical structure. This is consistent with the role of reward in the oculomotor neural circuitry and supports a reinforcement learning approach to understanding gaze control in natural environments.},

abstract = {Listeners are often capable of adjusting to the variability contained in individual talkers' (speakers') speech. The vast majority of findings on talker adaptation are concerned with learning the contingency between phonological characteristics and talker identity. In contrast, the present study investigates representations at a more abstract level - the contingency between syntactic attachment style and talker identity. In a 'visual-world' experiment, participants were exposed to semi-realistic scenes depicting several objects (e.g., an adult man, a young girl, a motorbike, a carousel, and other objects) accompanied by a spoken sentence with a structurally ambiguous relative clause (e.g., 'The uncle of the girl who will ride the motorbike/carousel is from France.' In the context of the scene, 'motorbike' suggested the uncle as the agent of the riding, whereas 'carousel' suggested the girl as the agent). For half the experimental items, one version of the sentence was read by one talker, who always uttered sentences that resolved, pragmatically, to the high attachment (the uncle as the agent), and the other by another talker, who always uttered sentences resolving to the low attachment (the girl as the agent). For the other half of the experimental items, both versions were read by a third talker who produced both high and low attachments. It was found that, after exposure to these stimuli, and for new sentences not heard previously, participants learnt to anticipate the 'appropriate' attachment depending on talker identity (with no attachment preference for the talker who produced both attachment types). The data suggest that listeners can learn the relationship between talker identity and abstract, structural, properties of their speech, and that syntactic attachment decisions in comprehension can reflect sensitivity to talker-specific syntactic style.},

abstract = {Osherson and Smith (1981, Cognition, 11, 237-262) discuss a number of problems which arise for a prototype-based account of the meanings of simple and complex concepts. Assuming that concept combination in such a theory is to be analyzed in terms of fuzzy logic, they show that some complex concepts inevitably get assigned the wrong meanings. In the present paper we argue that many of the problems O{\&}S discovered are due to difficulties that are intrinsic to fuzzy set theory, and that most of them disappear when fuzzy logic is replaced by supervaluation theory. However, even after this replacement one of O{\&}S's central problems remains: the theory still predicts that the degree to which an object is an instance of, say, "stripped apple" must be less than or equal to both the degree to which it is an instance of "striped" and the degree to which it is an instance of "apple", but this constraint conflicts with and the degree to which it is an instance of "apple", but this constraint conflicts with O{\&}S's experimental results. The second part of the paper explores ways of solving this and related problems. This leads us to suggest a number of distinctions and principles concerning how prototypicality and other mechanisms interact and which seem important for semantics generally. Prominent among these are (i) the distinction between on the one hand the logical and semantic properties of concepts and on the other the linguistic that between concepts for which the extension is determined by their prototype and concepts for which extension and prototypicality are independent.},

abstract = {Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we found an area in the fusiform gyrus in 12 of the 15 subjects tested that was significantly more active when the subjects viewed faces than when they viewed assorted common objects. This face activation was used to define a specific region of interest individually for each subject, within which several new tests of face specificity were run. In each of five subjects tested, the predefined candidate "face area" also responded significantly more strongly to passive viewing of (1) intact than scrambled two-tone faces, (2) full front-view face photos than front-view photos of houses, and (in a different set of five subjects) (3) three-quarter-view face photos (with hair concealed) than photos of human hands; it also responded more strongly during (4) a consecutive matching task performed on three-quarter-view faces versus hands. Our technique of running multiple tests applied to the same region defined functionally within individual subjects provides a solution to two common problems in functional imaging: (1) the requirement to correct for multiple statistical comparisons and (2) the inevitable ambiguity in the interpretation of any study in which only two or three conditions are compared. Our data allow us to reject alternative accounts of the function of the fusiform face area (area "FF") that appeal to visual attention, subordinate-level classification, or general processing of any animate or human forms, demonstrating that this region is selectively involved in the perception of faces.},

abstract = {Recent investigations of the acquisition of scalar implicature report that young children do not reliably reject a sentence with a weak scalar term, e.g. 'some of the books are red', when it is used as a description of a situation where a stronger statement is true, e.g. where all the books are red. This is taken as evidence that children do not interpret the sentence with the implicature that the stronger statement does not hold. We propose that (a) these tasks cannot differentiate between actual implicature derivation and mere sensitivity to violations of informativeness; and that (b) children's apparent failure is not due to lack of competence (whether with informativeness or implicature) but due to their tolerance of pragmatic violations. We report three studies with 5-to-6-year-old English-speaking children and adults employing utterances involving scalar and non-scalar expressions. These show that both age-groups are competent with informativeness, but also tolerant of pragmatic infelicity. These findings have implications for the well-established literature on whether children are aware of ambiguity in referential communication tasks.},

abstract = {Everyday inductive inferences are often guided by rich background knowledge. Formal models of induction should aim to incorporate this knowledge and should explain how different kinds of knowledge lead to the distinctive patterns of reasoning found in different inductive contexts. This article presents a Bayesian framework that attempts to meet both goals and describes [corrected] 4 applications of the framework: a taxonomic model, a spatial model, a threshold model, and a causal model. Each model makes probabilistic inferences about the extensions of novel properties, but the priors for the 4 models are defined over different kinds of structures that capture different relationships between the categories in a domain. The framework therefore shows how statistical inference can operate over structured background knowledge, and the authors argue that this interaction between structure and statistics is critical for explaining the power and flexibility of human reasoning.},

abstract = {To use sensory information efficiently to make judgments and guide action in the world, the brain must represent and use information about uncertainty in its computations for perception and action. Bayesian methods have proven successful in building computational theories for perception and sensorimotor control, and psychophysics is providing a growing body of evidence that human perceptual computations are "Bayes' optimal". This leads to the "Bayesian coding hypothesis": that the brain represents sensory information probabilistically, in the form of probability distributions. Several computational schemes have recently been proposed for how this might be achieved in populations of neurons. Neurophysiological data on the hypothesis, however, is almost non-existent. A major challenge for neuroscientists is to test these ideas experimentally, and so determine whether and how neurons code information about sensory uncertainty.},

abstract = {Speakers often overspecify their target descriptions and include more information than necessary for unique identification of the target referent. In the current paper, we study the production of definite target descriptions, and explore several factors that might influence the amount of information that is included in these descriptions. First, we present the results of a large-scale experiment investigating referential overspecification as a function of the properties of a target referent and the communicative setting. The results show that speakers (both in written and oral conditions) tend to provide more information when a target is plural rather than singular, and in domains where the speaker has more referential possibilities to describe the target. However, written and spoken referring expressions do not differ in terms of semantic redundancy. We conclude our paper by discussing the implications of our empirical findings for pragmatic theory and for language production models. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This study investigates to what extent the amount of variation in a visual scene causes speakers to mention the attribute color in their definite target descriptions, focusing on scenes in which this attribute is not needed for identification of the target. The results of our three experiments show that speakers are more likely to redundantly include a color attribute when the scene variation is high as compared with when this variation is low (even if this leads to overspecified descriptions). We argue that these findings are problematic for existing algorithms that aim to automatically generate psychologically realistic target descriptions, such as the Incremental Algorithm, as these algorithms make use of a fixed preference order per domain and do not take visual scene variation into account.},

abstract = {Perceptual events derive their significance to an animal from their meaning about the world, that is from the information they carry about their causes. The brain should thus be able to efficiently infer the causes underlying our sensory events. Here we use multisensory cue combination to study causal inference in perception. We formulate an ideal-observer model that infers whether two sensory cues originate from the same location and that also estimates their location(s). This model accurately predicts the nonlinear integration of cues by human subjects in two auditory-visual localization tasks. The results show that indeed humans can efficiently infer the causal structure as well as the location of causes. By combining insights from the study of causal inference with the ideal-observer approach to sensory cue combination, we show that the capacity to infer causal structure is not limited to conscious, high-level cognition; it is also performed continually and effortlessly in perception.},

abstract = {When we learn a new motor skill, such as playing an approaching tennis ball, both our sensors and the task possess variability. Our sensors provide imperfect information about the ball's velocity, so we can only estimate it. Combining information from multiple modalities can reduce the error in this estimate. On a longer time scale, not all velocities are a priori equally probable, and over the course of a match there will be a probability distribution of velocities. According to bayesian theory, an optimal estimate results from combining information about the distribution of velocities-the prior-with evidence from sensory feedback. As uncertainty increases, when playing in fog or at dusk, the system should increasingly rely on prior knowledge. To use a bayesian strategy, the brain would need to represent the prior distribution and the level of uncertainty in the sensory feedback. Here we control the statistical variations of a new sensorimotor task and manipulate the uncertainty of the sensory feedback. We show that subjects internally represent both the statistical distribution of the task and their sensory uncertainty, combining them in a manner consistent with a performance-optimizing bayesian process. The central nervous system therefore employs probabilistic models during sensorimotor learning.},

abstract = {Notions of objecthood have traditionally been cast in visuocentric terminology. As a result, theories of auditory and cross-modal perception have focused more on the differences between modalities than on the similarities. In this paper we re-examine the concept of an object in a way that overcomes the limitations of the traditional perspective. We propose a new, cross-modal conception of objecthood which focuses on the similarities between modalities instead of the differences. Further, we propose that the auditory system might consist of two parallel streams of processing (the 'what' and 'where' subsystems) in a manner analogous to current conceptions of the visual system. We suggest that the 'what' subsystems in each modality are concerned with objecthood. Finally, we present evidence for - and elaborate on - the hypothesis that the auditory 'where' subsystem is in the service of the visual-motor 'where' subsystem.},

@article{kuperberg2007,
abstract = {In 1980, the N400 event-related potential was described in association with semantic anomalies within sentences. When, in 1992, a second waveform, the P600, was reported in association with syntactic anomalies and ambiguities, the story appeared to be complete: the brain respected a distinction between semantic and syntactic representation and processes. Subsequent studies showed that the P600 to syntactic anomalies and ambiguities was modulated by lexical and discourse factors. Most surprisingly, more than a decade after the P600 was first described, a series of studies reported that semantic verb-argument violations, in the absence of any violations or ambiguities of syntax can evoke robust P600 effects and no N400 effects. These observations have raised fundamental questions about the relationship between semantic and syntactic processing in the brain. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the recent studies that have demonstrated P600s to semantic violations in light of several proposed triggers: semantic-thematic attraction, semantic associative relationships, animacy and semantic-thematic violations, plausibility, task, and context. I then discuss these findings in relation to a unifying theory that attempts to bring some of these factors together and to link the P600 produced by semantic verb-argument violations with the P600 evoked by unambiguous syntactic violations and syntactic ambiguities. I suggest that normal language comprehension proceeds along at least two competing neural processing streams: a semantic memory-based mechanism, and a combinatorial mechanism (or mechanisms) that assigns structure to a sentence primarily on the basis of morphosyntactic rules, but also on the basis of certain semantic-thematic constraints. I suggest that conflicts between the different representations that are output by these distinct but interactive streams lead to a continued combinatorial analysis that is reflected by the P600 effect. I discuss some of the implications of this non-syntactocentric, dynamic model of language processing for understanding individual differences, language processing disorders and the neuroanatomical circuitry engaged during language comprehension. Finally, I suggest that that these two processing streams may generalize beyond the language system to real-world visual event comprehension.},

abstract = {The face communicates an impressive amount of visual information. We use it to identify its owner, how they are feeling and to help us understand what they are saying. Models of face processing have considered how we extract such meaning from the face but have ignored another important signal - eye gaze. In this article we begin by reviewing evidence from recent neurophysiological studies that suggests that the eyes constitute a special stimulus in at least two senses. First, the structure of the eyes is such that it provides us with a particularly powerful signal to the direction of another person's gaze, and second, we may have evolved neural mechanisms devoted to gaze processing. As a result, gaze direction is analysed rapidly and automatically, and is able to trigger reflexive shifts of an observer's visual attention. However, understanding where another individual is directing their attention involves more than simply analysing their gaze direction. We go on to describe research with adult participants, children and non-human primates that suggests that other cues such as head orientation and pointing gestures make significant contributions to the computation of another's direction of attention.},

abstract = {Preparing words in speech production is normally a fast and accurate process. We generate them two or three per second in fluent conversation; and overtly naming a clear picture of an object can easily be initiated within 600 msec after picture onset. The underlying process, however, is exceedingly complex. The theory reviewed in this target article analyzes this process as staged and feed-forward. After a first stage of conceptual preparation, word generation proceeds through lexical selection, morphological and phonological encoding, phonetic encoding, and articulation itself. In addition, the speaker exerts some degree of output control, by monitoring of self-produced internal and overt speech. The core of the theory, ranging from lexical selection to the initiation of phonetic encoding, is captured in a computational model, called WEAVER++. Both the theory and the computational model have been developed in interaction with reaction time experiments, particularly in picture naming or related word production paradigms, with the aim of accounting for the real-time processing in normal word production. A comprehensive review of theory, model, and experiments is presented. The model can handle some of the main observations in the domain of speech errors (the major empirical domain for most other theories of lexical access), and the theory opens new ways of approaching the cerebral organization of speech production by way of high-temporal-resolution imaging.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the role of resource allocation as a source of processing difficulty in human sentence comprehension. The paper proposes a simple information-theoretic characterization of processing difficulty as the work incurred by resource reallocation during parallel, incremental, probabilistic disambiguation in sentence comprehension, and demonstrates its equivalence to the theory of Hale [Hale, J. (2001). A probabilistic Earley parser as a psycholinguistic model. In Proceedings of NAACL (Vol. 2, pp. 159-166)], in which the difficulty of a word is proportional to its surprisal (its negative log-probability) in the context within which it appears. This proposal subsumes and clarifies findings that high-constraint contexts can facilitate lexical processing, and connects these findings to well-known models of parallel constraint-based comprehension. In addition, the theory leads to a number of specific predictions about the role of expectation in syntactic comprehension, including the reversal of locality-based difficulty patterns in syntactically constrained contexts, and conditions under which increased ambiguity facilitates processing. The paper examines a range of established results bearing on these predictions, and shows that they are largely consistent with the surprisal theory.},

abstract = {In prevailing approaches to human sentence comprehension, the outcome of the word recognition process is assumed to be a categorical representation with no residual uncertainty. Yet perception is inevitably uncertain, and a system making optimal use of available information might retain this uncertainty and interactively recruit grammatical analysis and subsequent perceptual input to help resolve it. To test for the possibility of such an interaction, we tracked readers' eye movements as they read sentences constructed to vary in (i) whether an early word had near neighbors of a different grammatical category, and (ii) how strongly another word further downstream cohered grammatically with these potential near neighbors. Eye movements indicated that readers maintain uncertain beliefs about previously read word identities, revise these beliefs on the basis of relative grammatical consistency with subsequent input, and use these changing beliefs to guide saccadic behavior in ways consistent with principles of rational probabilistic inference.},

abstract = {We present a detailed process theory of the moment-by-moment working-memory retrievals and associated control structure that subserve sentence comprehension. The theory is derived from the application of independently motivated principles of memory and cognitive skill to the specialized task of sentence parsing. The resulting theory construes sentence processing as a series of skilled associative memory retrievals modulated by similarity-based interference and fluctuating activation. The cognitive principles are formalized in computational form in the Adaptive Control of ThoughtRational (ACTR) architecture, and our process model is realized in ACTR. We present the results of 6 sets of simulations: 5 simulation sets provide quantitative accounts of the effects of length and structural interference on both unambiguous and garden-path structures. A final simulation set provides a graded taxonomy of double center embeddings ranging from relatively easy to extremely difficult. The explanation of center-embedding difficulty is a novel one that derives from the model' complete reliance on discriminating retrieval cues in the absence of an explicit representation of serial order information. All fits were obtained with only 1 free scaling parameter fixed across the simulations; all other parameters were ACTR defaults. The modeling results support the hypothesis that fluctuating activation and similarity-based interference are the key factors shaping working memory in sentence processing. We contrast the theory and empirical predictions with several related accounts of sentence-processing complexity.},

abstract = {A current debate in psycholinguistics concerns how speakers take addressees' knowledge or needs into account during the packaging of utterances. In retelling stories, speakers are more likely to mention atypical instruments than easily inferrable, typical instruments; in a seminal study, Brown and Dell (1987) suggested that this is not an adjustment to addressees but is simply easiest for speakers. They concluded that manipulating addressees' knowledge did not affect speakers' mention of instruments. However, their addressees were confederates who heard the same stories repeatedly. We had speakers retell stories to naive addressees who either saw or did not see a picture illustrating the main action and instrument. When addressees lacked pictures, speakers were more likely to mention atypical instruments, to mention them early (within the same clause as the action verb), and to mark atypical instruments as indefinite. This suggests that with visual copresence, speakers can take addressees' knowledge into account in early syntactic choices.},

Although the verbal storage system has been well characterized, the storage capacity of visual working memory has not yet been established for simple, suprathreshold features or for conjunctions of features. Here we demonstrate that it is possible to retain information about only four colours or orientations in visual working memory at one time. However, it is also possible to retain both the colour and the orientation of four objects, indicating that visual working memory stores integrated objects rather than individual features. Indeed, objects defined by a conjunction of four features can be retained in working memory just as well as single-feature objects, allowing sixteen individual features to be retained when distributed across four objects. Thus, the capacity of visual working memory must be understood in terms of integrated objects rather than individual features, which places significant constraints on cognitive and neurobiological models of the temporary storage of visual information.},

abstract = {Recent psychophysical experiments indicate that humans perform near-optimal Bayesian inference in a wide variety of tasks, ranging from cue integration to decision making to motor control. This implies that neurons both represent probability distributions and combine those distributions according to a close approximation to Bayes' rule. At first sight, it would seem that the high variability in the responses of cortical neurons would make it difficult to implement such optimal statistical inference in cortical circuits. We argue that, in fact, this variability implies that populations of neurons automatically represent probability distributions over the stimulus, a type of code we call probabilistic population codes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Poisson-like variability observed in cortex reduces a broad class of Bayesian inference to simple linear combinations of populations of neural activity. These results hold for arbitrary probability distributions over the stimulus, for tuning curves of arbitrary shape and for realistic neuronal variability.},

Recent studies suggest that humans and animals use Bayesian strategies to solve both problems. With regard to how to integrate, computational studies have also started to shed light on the neural basis of this Bayes-optimal computation, suggesting that, if neuronal variability is Poisson-like, a simple linear combination of population activity is all that is required for optimality.

abstract = {Frames of reference are coordinate systems used to compute and specify the location of objects with respect to other objects. These have long been thought of as innate concepts, built into our neurocognition. However, recent work shows that the use of such frames in language, cognition and gesture varies cross-culturally, and that children can acquire different systems with comparable ease. We argue that language can play a significant role in structuring, or restructuring, a domain as fundamental as spatial cognition. This suggests we need to rethink the relation between the neurocognitive underpinnings of spatial cognition and the concepts we use in everyday thinking, and, more generally, to work out how to account for cross-cultural cognitive diversity in core cognitive domains.},

In Experiment 1 newly hatched chicks, imprinted on a three-dimensional (3-D) object, were allowed to choose between the shadows of the familiar object and of an object never seen before. In Experiments 2 and 3 random-dot displays were used to produce the perception of a solid shape only when set in motion. Overall, the results showed that domestic chicks were able to recognize familiar shapes from 2-D motion stimuli. It is likely that similar general mechanisms underlying the perception of structure-from-motion and the extraction of 3-D information are shared by humans and animals. The present data shows that they occur similarly in birds as known for mammals, two separate vertebrate classes; this possibly indicates a common phylogenetic origin of these processes.},

The central concerns are whether the models prescribe maximally efficient (optimal) integration and to what extent the models are psychologically valid. Evaluation, integration, and decision processes are specified for each model. Important features are whether evaluation is noisy, whether integration follows Bayes's theorem, and whether decision consists of a criterion rule or a relative goodness rule. Simulations of the models and predictions of the results by the same models are carried out to provide a measure of identifiability or the extent to which the models can be distinguished from one another. The models are also contrasted against empirical results from tasks with 2 and 4 response alternatives and with graded responses.},

The interactive approach to understanding this effect posits that this facilitation is accomplished through bi-directional flow of information, allowing lexical knowledge to influence pre-lexical processes. Alternative autonomous theories posit feed-forward processing with lexical influence restricted to post-perceptual decision processes. We review evidence supporting the prediction of interactive models that lexical influences can affect pre-lexical mechanisms, triggering compensation, adaptation and retuning of phonological processes generally taken to be pre-lexical. We argue that these and other findings point to interactive processing as a fundamental principle for perception of speech and other modalities.},

It is important when considering the extent of thyroidectomy and the management of lymph node metastases to balance the outcome of treatment in terms of recurrence and mortality with the morbidity of the procedure. Total thyroidectomy and lymphadenectomy for macroscopic lymph node metastases appear to be the optimal therapy for most patients with DTC.

abstract = {Time course estimates from eye tracking during spoken language processing (the "visual world paradigm", or VWP) have enabled progress on debates regarding fine-grained details of activation and competition over time. There are, however, three gaps in current analyses of VWP data: consideration of time in a statistically rigorous manner, quantification of individual differences, and distinguishing linguistic effects from non-linguistic effects. To address these gaps, we have developed an approach combining statistical and computational modeling. The statistical approach (growth curve analysis, a technique explicitly designed to assess change over time at group and individual levels) provides a rigorous means of analyzing time course data. We introduce the method and its application to VWP data. We also demonstrate the potential for assessing whether differences in group or individual data are best explained by linguistic processing or decisional aspects of VWP tasks through comparison of growth curve analyses and computational modeling, and discuss the potential benefits for studying typical and atypical language processing.},

abstract = {The past 50 years have seen an accumulation of evidence suggesting that associative learning depends on high-level cognitive processes that give rise to propositional knowledge. Yet, many learning theorists maintain a belief in a learning mechanism in which links between mental representations are formed automatically. We characterize and highlight the differences between the propositional and link approaches, and review the relevant empirical evidence. We conclude that learning is the consequence of propositional reasoning processes that cooperate with the unconscious processes involved in memory retrieval and perception. We argue that this new conceptual framework allows many of the important recent advances in associative learning research to be retained, but recast in a model that provides a firmer foundation for both immediate application and future research.},

annote = {- discussion of constant entropy rate in the context of multifractality in language. finds evidence of multifractal properties across different timw scales (traditional levels of linguistic processing). optimization of communication, not just signal transmission, implying that info processing rate doesn't remain constant but decreases over time. non-stationarity.
        
- starts with assumption that rate at which linguistic info is processed in production {\&}amp; comprehension is roughly constant (UID) 
        
- there are correlations not only between adjacent or close elements, but also over long lags. supposedly these can even be infinite (ie identities of any two elements in a linguistic stream will be correlate no matter how many other ones intervene between them)
	-{\&}gt; hallmark of stochastic fractals
        
- if there is this kind of fractality in language this would have consequences for CER/UID
        
- magnitude of correlation between sequences with long-range correlations (LRC) as opposed to independent elements (white noise) or short rnage correlations (Markov chains) is given by power law of separating lag
        
- symbolic sequences with multifractal structure are characterized by being non-stationary (ie statistical properties change with time) and inhomogeneous (their composition in terms of symbols at different scales changes with time)
        
- why should one expect that natural language is multifractal: 
	1. topic, lexical composition, style etc can often change abruptly along discourse
		--{\&}gt; really? for topic i see that, but for the rest?
	2. linguistic sequences are result of superposition of multiple discrete levels of structure (phonological, lexical, morphological, syntactic, pragmatic) which operate at different length scales
        
- problems with CER/UID (mild problems first, crescendo)
	1. methodological issue: sth about using non-linear regression
	2. inconsistencies in formulation of CER:
		- does info conveyed by words remain constant along discourse?
		- info conveyed by syllable?
		-{\&}gt; if two words have different length, info/time means total info supplied by words is different -{\&}gt; contradiction
	-{\&}gt; so the question really is: at what level of processing is information density expected to be constant? different time taken up at different levels will interact, so that if the info is constant on one level, it can't be on another (because for example two clauses might differ in length, ie {\#} of words)
	3. LRC stands in contradiction to UID/CER:
		- CER says that conditional entropy remains constant along text or utterance
		- for stationary process, conditional entropy can either monotonically decrease or remain constant (the latter only if the elements in the sequence aren't correlated)
		- but language exhibits LRCs, that is, elements in linguistic streams are always correlated, no matter how big the lag between them, so the conditional entropy must be monotonically decreasing, counter CER 
		- different formulation: optimal use of channel would remove correlations (optimal data compression). but we see massive redundancy in language, which enables achieve not just efficient, but robust, communication
		- language is not a stationary process, though that is the assumption that the tests of CER/UID rest on
        
- proposes relaxed CER (rCER) hypothesis: that CER operates only on one, but not all levels of linguistic description (because that's impossible)
        
- what he actually ends up showing, according to him:
	1. ling structure exhibits LRCs (incompatible with CER)
	2. structure in texts is multifractal
	3. different scales correspond to linguistic levels of description (lexico-morphological, syntactic, pragmatic)
	4. text are non-stationary. long-scale structuring of discourse, probably online cognitive adjustments for optiml channel use
	5. though CER hypothesis itself not borne out, there is evidence for multiscale adjustments of lexical properties to attenuate decrease in per-word entropy rate
        
- consequences for CER/UID},

abstract = {This article brings together two independent lines of research on numerally quantified expressions, e.g. two girls. One stems from work in linguistic theory and asks what truth conditional contributions such expressions make to the utterances in which they are used--in other words, what do numerals mean? The other comes from the study of language development and asks when and how children learn the meaning of such expressions. My goal is to show that when integrated, these two perspectives can both constrain and enrich each other in ways hitherto not considered. Specifically, work in linguistic theory suggests that in addition to their 'exactly n' interpretation, numerally quantified NPs such as two hoops can also receive an 'at least n' and an 'at most n' interpretation, e.g. you need to put two hoops on the pole to win (i.e. at least two hoops) and you can miss two shots and still win (i.e. at most two shots). I demonstrate here through the results of three sets of experiments that by the age of 5 children have implicit knowledge of the fact that expressions like two N can be interpreted as 'at least two N' and 'at most two N' while they do not yet know the meaning of corresponding expressions such as at least/most two N which convey these senses explicitly. I show that these results have important implications for theories of the semantics of numerals and that they raise new questions for developmental accounts of the number vocabulary.},

Previous research suggests that goal-driven attention enhances the gain of neurons representing the target's visual features. Here, we present mathematical and behavioral evidence that this strategy is suboptimal and that humans do not deploy it. We formally derive the optimal feature gain modulation theory, which combines information from both the target and distracting clutter to maximize the relative salience of the target. We qualitatively validate the theory against existing electrophysiological and psychophysical literature. A surprising prediction is that it is sometimes optimal to enhance nontarget features. We provide experimental evidence toward this through psychophysics experiments on human subjects, thus suggesting that humans deploy the optimal gain modulation strategy.},

Computational optimization found situations in which information gain, probability gain, and impact strongly contradict Bayesian diagnosticity. In these situations, diagnosticity's claims are normatively inferior. Results of a new experiment strongly contradict the predictions of Bayesian diagnosticity. Normative theoretical concerns also argue against use of diagnosticity. It is concluded that Bayesian diagnosticity is normatively flawed and empirically unjustified.},

abstract = {In linguistic theories of how sentences encode meaning, a distinction is often made between the context-free rule-based combination of lexical-semantic features of the words within a sentence ("semantics"), and the contributions made by wider context ("pragmatics"). In psycholinguistics, this distinction has led to the view that listeners initially compute a local, context-independent meaning of a phrase or sentence before relating it to the wider context. An important aspect of such a two-step perspective on interpretation is that local semantics cannot initially be overruled by global contextual factors. In two spoken-language event-related potential experiments, we tested the viability of this claim by examining whether discourse context can overrule the impact of the core lexical-semantic feature animacy, considered to be an innate organizing principle of cognition. Two-step models of interpretation predict that verb-object animacy violations, as in "The girl comforted the clock," will always perturb the unfolding interpretation process, regardless of wider context. When presented in isolation, such anomalies indeed elicit a clear N400 effect, a sign of interpretive problems. However, when the anomalies were embedded in a supportive context (e.g., a girl talking to a clock about his depression), this N400 effect disappeared completely. Moreover, given a suitable discourse context (e.g., a story about an amorous peanut), animacy-violating predicates ("the peanut was in love") were actually processed more easily than canonical predicates ("the peanut was salted"). Our findings reveal that discourse context can immediately overrule local lexical-semantic violations, and therefore suggest that language comprehension does not involve an initially context-free semantic analysis.},

abstract = {A conversational implicature is an inference that consists of attributing to a speaker an implicit meaning that goes beyond the explicit linguistic meaning of an utterance. This paper experimentally investigates scalar implicature, a paradigmatic case of implicature in which a speaker's use of a term like Some indicates that the speaker had reasons not to use a more informative term from the same scale, e.g. All; thus, Some implicates Not all. Pragmatic theorists like Grice would predict that a pragmatic interpretation is determined only after its explicit, logical meaning is incorporated (e.g. where Some means at least one). The present work aims to developmentally examine this prediction by showing how younger, albeit competent, reasoners initially treat a relatively weak term logically before becoming aware of its pragmatic potential. Three experiments are presented. Experiment 1 presents a modal reasoning scenario offering an exhaustive set of conclusions; critical among these is participants' evaluation of a statement expressing Might be x when the context indicates that the stronger Must be x is true. The conversationally-infelicitous Might be x can be understood logically (e.g. as compatible with Must) or pragmatically (as exclusive to Must). Results from 5-, 7-, and 9-year-olds as well as adults revealed that (a) 7-year-olds are the youngest to demonstrate modal competence overall and that (b) 7- and 9-year-olds treat the infelicitous Might logically significantly more often than adults do. Experiment 2 showed how training with the modal task can suspend the implicatures for adults. Experiment 3 provides converging evidence of the developmental pragmatic effect with the French existential quantifier Certains (Some). While linguistically-sophisticated children (8- and 10-year-olds olds) typically treat Certains as compatible with Tous (All), adults are equivocal. These results, which are consistent with unanticipated findings in classic developmental papers, reveal a consistent ordering in which representations of weak scalar terms tend to be treated logically by young competent participants and more pragmatically by older ones. This work is also relevant to the treatment of scalar implicatures in the reasoning literature.},

Although it has been an ever present aspect of linguistic analyses and discussions, it is only over the last ten years or so that cognitive scientists have been investigating--in a concerted fashion--the pragmatic features of language experimentally. We begin by highlighting Paul Grice's contributions to ordinary language philosophy and show how it has led to this active area of experimental investigation. We then focus on two exemplary phenomena--'scalar inference' and 'reference resolution'--before considering other topics that fit into the paradigm known as 'experimental pragmatics'.},

@article{Oaksford2009,
abstract = {According to Aristotle, humans are the rational animal. The borderline between rationality and irrationality is fundamental to many aspects of human life including the law, mental health, and language interpretation. But what is it to be rational? One answer, deeply embedded in the Western intellectual tradition since ancient Greece, is that rationality concerns reasoning according to the rules of logic--the formal theory that specifies the inferential connections that hold with certainty between propositions. Piaget viewed logical reasoning as defining the end-point of cognitive development; and contemporary psychology of reasoning has focussed on comparing human reasoning against logical standards. Bayesian Rationality argues that rationality is defined instead by the ability to reason about uncertainty. Although people are typically poor at numerical reasoning about probability, human thought is sensitive to subtle patterns of qualitative Bayesian, probabilistic reasoning. In Chapters 1-4 of Bayesian Rationality (Oaksford {\&} Chater 2007), the case is made that cognition in general, and human everyday reasoning in particular, is best viewed as solving probabilistic, rather than logical, inference problems. In Chapters 5-7 the psychology of "deductive" reasoning is tackled head-on: It is argued that purportedly "logical" reasoning problems, revealing apparently irrational behaviour, are better understood from a probabilistic point of view. Data from conditional reasoning, Wason's selection task, and syllogistic inference are captured by recasting these problems probabilistically. The probabilistic approach makes a variety of novel predictions which have been experimentally confirmed. The book considers the implications of this work, and the wider "probabilistic turn" in cognitive science and artificial intelligence, for understanding human rationality.},
annote = {- what the paper does: definition of bayesian rationality, application to a variety of reasoning tasks (conditional reasoning, Wason's selection task, syllogistic inference), discussion of some potential problems
        
- distinction between rationality as following logical/mathematical rules vs Bayesian rationality as adapted reasoning about uncertainty
        
- probabilities in Bayesian rationality interpreted as subjective probabilities or degrees of belief
        
- logical arguments: entirely dependent on structure. if premises true, conclusion true (given validity of argument). no appeal to contingent facts (though there are of course a bunch of non-monotonic logics aimed at dealing with belief update...)
        
- calls people that like the idea of the mind as a logical machine logicists, endorsing the logicist position. eg Piaget, Newell {\&}amp; Simon, Chomsky. in contrast, wason at the same time got these weird results
        
- accounts that try to deal with Wason's findings: mental logic (Braine, Rips), mental models (Johnson-Laird), social contract theory (Cosmides)
        
- relationshiop between normative mathematical theory of reasoning and often clashing empirical evidence about how people DO reason: normative theory as a component of rational analysis
	- core objective of rational analysis is to understand structure of problem from point of view of the cogntive system
        
- important assumption often relevant in Step 2 of rational analysis: feature of environment tend to occur with very low probability (rarity assumption) {\&}amp; probabilistic constraints often independent (or mostly independent) of each other
        
- caveats
	- status of rational analysis: NOT a theory of processes (algorithmic level). suited to provide computational level theories of
 systems' behavior given problem they're trying to solve {\&}amp; the environment 
	- important to make distinction between structure of human reasoning {\&}amp; performance on explicit logic/probabilistic problems. cognitive mechanisms may actually follow/approximate probability theory without being able to consciously reason about probabilities. so even if the mind is a probabilistic machine, it might not work with symbolically/verbally/numerically stated puzzles because that's not what we're adapted to do
        
- why are we so bad at deductive reasoning?
	- important assumption: everyday real-world reasoning is very rarely deductive (monotonic). mostly non-monotonic belief update, can often be cancelled. 
		--{\&}gt; SI's for example
		--{\&}gt; while the assumption seems reasonable, they only provide anecdotal evidence but no proof. this is important because it seems like THE most crucial assumption you need to make about why we're so bad at deductive reasoning (in the logical sense) and so good at it (in the Bayesian rationality sense)
	- frame problem persists also in a bayesian framework
        
- related to the non-monotonic inference issue: our beliefs (perceptual, scientific, commonsense, etc) are tentative and provisional. there are no absolute certainties. 
	--{\&}gt; though if you say this you might cite your jumping into the canal anecdote as an extreme case of belief update
        
- talk about language as also having undergone the probabilistic turn: {\&}quot;natural language statements should be interpreted as making probabilistic, rather than logical, claims{\&}quot;
	--{\&}gt; unclear to me whether they're saying that speakers {\&}amp; comprehenders always have complete certainty about what is said, but that the content of that should be interpreted probabilistically, or if they're using sloppy terminology and are saying what eg florian/roger etc are saying: that we have uncertainty over what is being said and the inferences to draw from that in the first place
        
- generally widespread application of bayesian methods {\&}amp; rational moels: cognitive phenomena (chater {\&}amp; oaksford), categorization (anderson), memory (anderson * milson), conditioning, causal learning, natural language processing, vision
        
- issues that people have with the bayesian approach:
	- lack of claims about psychological processes, only computational level theory is unsatisfactory
		- algorithmic level theories often premature. first we need to understand the problem that people are trying to solve.},

Modifying the interpretation of few to take into account the distinction between positive and negative quantifiers (Moxey {\&} Sanford, 1993) indicated two orderings over the quantifiers all, most, few, some, none, and some...not that are more consistent with the results. Experiments 1-3 tested these orderings empirically by having participants rank whether a quantifier applied to a particular probabilistic state of affairs. Experiments 1 and 2 showed that participants agreed on when a quantifier applied and that the empirically derived informativeness orderings were consistent with the proposed modifications of the order. Experiment 3 showed that this finding was robust even when response competition was eliminated.},

Past research has found that typical items tend to be mentioned before atypical items in a phrase--a pattern usually associated with lexical variables (like word frequency), and yet typicality is a conceptual variable. Experiment 1 revealed that an appropriate conceptual framework was necessary to yield the typicality effect. Experiment 2 tested ad hoc categories that do not have prior representations in long-term memory and yielded no typicality effect. Experiment 3 used carefully matched sentences in which two category members appeared in the same or in different phrases. Typicality affected word order only when the two words appeared in the same phrase. These results are consistent with an account in which typicality has its origin in conceptual structure, which leads to differences in lexical accessibility in appropriate contexts.},

abstract = {There has been much debate, in both the linguistics and the psycholinguistics literature, concerning numbers and the interpretation of number denoting determiners ('numerals'). Such debate concerns, in particular, the nature and distribution of upper-bounded ('at-least') interpretations vs. lower-bounded ('exact') construals. In the present paper we show that the interpretation and processing of numerals are affected by the entailment properties of the context in which they occur. Experiment 1 established off-line preferences using a questionnaire. Experiment 2 investigated the processing issue through an eye tracking experiment using a silent reading task. Our results show that the upper-bounded interpretation of numerals occurs more often in an upward entailing context than in a downward entailing context. Reading times of the numeral itself were longer when it was embedded in an upward entailing context than when it was not, indicating that processing resources were required when the context triggered an upper-bounded interpretation. However, reading of a following context that required an upper-bounded interpretation triggered more regressions towards the numeral when it had occurred in a downward entailing context than in an upward entailing one. Such findings show that speakers' interpretation and processing of numerals is systematically affected by the polarity of the sentence in which they occur, and support the hypothesis that the upper-bounded interpretation of numerals is due to a scalar implicature.},

abstract = {In this article we present two sets of experiments designed to investigate the acquisition of scalar implicatures. Scalar implicatures arise in examples like Some professors are famous where the speaker's use of some typically indicates that s/he had reasons not to use a more informative term, e.g. all. Some professors are famous therefore gives rise to the implicature that not all professors are famous. Recent studies on the development of pragmatics suggest that preschool children are often insensitive to such implicatures when they interpret scalar terms (Cognition 78 (2001) 165; Chierchia, G., Crain, S., Guasti, M.T., Gualmini, A., {\&} Meroni, L. (2001). The acquisition of disjunction: evidence for a grammatical view of scalar implicatures. In A.H.-J. Do, L. Dominguez, {\&} A. Johansen (Eds.), Proceedings of the 25th Boston University Conference on Language Development (pp. 157-168). Somerville, MA: Cascadilla Press; Musolino, J., {\&} Lidz, J. (2002). Preschool logic: truth and felicity in the acquisition of quantification. In B. Skarabela, S. Fish, {\&} A.H.-J. Do, Proceedings of the 26th Boston University Conference on Language Development (pp. 406-416). Somerville, MA: Cascadilla Press). This conclusion raises two important questions: (a) are all scalar terms treated in the same way by young children?, and (b) does the child's difficulty reflect a genuine inability to derive scalar implicatures or is it due to demands imposed by the experimental task on an otherwise pragmatically savvy child? Experiment 1 addresses the first question by testing a group of 30 5-year-olds and 30 adults (all native speakers of Greek) on three different scales, <oli, meriki> (<all, some>), <tris, dio> (<three, two>) and <teliono, arxizo> (<finish, start>). In each case, subjects were presented with contexts which satisfied the semantic content of the stronger (i.e. more informative) terms on each scale (i.e. all, three and finish) but were described using the weaker terms of the scales (i.e. some, two, start). We found that, while adults overwhelmingly rejected these infelicitous descriptions, children almost never did so. Children also differed from adults in that their rejection rate on the numerical scale was reliably higher than on the two other scales. In order to address question (b), we trained a group of 30 5-year-olds to detect infelicitous statements. We then presented them with modified versions of the stories of Experiment 1, which now more readily invited scalar inferences. These manipulations gave rise to significantly higher rejection rates than those observed in Experiment 1. Overall, these findings indicate that children do not treat all scalar terms alike and, more importantly, that children's ability to derive scalar implicatures is affected by their awareness of the goal of the task. Developmental and methodological implications as well as theoretical implications for the semantics of numeral terms are discussed.},

- overall finding: word length is better predicted by that word's average information content than by its frequency (contra Zipf) in 10 different languages. conclusion that lexicons are efficiently structured for communication (given the statistics of natural language use)
        
- information content as providing  empirically supported and rationally motivated alternative to Zipf frequency-length relationship
	-{\&}gt; 2 key differences:
	1. lexicon based on information content would not be most concise one possible (would not shorten highly informative words)
	--{\&}gt; ?
	2. lexicon based on info content would keep information rate of communication as constant as possible (UID)
        
- methods:
	- calculate average info content (from google n-grams, n={\{}2,3,4{\}}) and frequency of words for 11 different languages and calculate Spearman ran correlation between both a) info content and word length and b) frequency and word length
	- languages: czech, dutch, english, french, german, italian, polish, portuguese, romanian, spanish, swedish. all european!!
        
- results: 
	- for n=2: info content better than frequency for all languages

abstract = {Traditional mechanistic accounts of language processing derive almost entirely from the study of monologue. Yet, the most natural and basic form of language use is dialogue. As a result, these accounts may only offer limited theories of the mechanisms that underlie language processing in general. We propose a mechanistic account of dialogue, the interactive alignment account, and use it to derive a number of predictions about basic language processes. The account assumes that, in dialogue, the linguistic representations employed by the interlocutors become aligned at many levels, as a result of a largely automatic process. This process greatly simplifies production and comprehension in dialogue. After considering the evidence for the interactive alignment model, we concentrate on three aspects of processing that follow from it. It makes use of a simple interactive inference mechanism, enables the development of local dialogue routines that greatly simplify language processing, and explains the origins of self-monitoring in production. We consider the need for a grammatical framework that is designed to deal with language in dialogue rather than monologue, and discuss a range of implications of the account.},

abstract = {Detection of a visual signal requires information to reach a system capable of eliciting arbitrary responses required by the experimenter. Detection latencies are reduced when subjects receive a cue that indicates where in the visual field the signal will occur. This shift in efficiency appears to be due to an alignment (orienting) of the central attentional system with the pathways to be activated by the visual input. It would also be possible to describe these results as being due to a reduced criterion at the expected target position. However, this description ignores important constraints about the way in which expectancy improves performance. First, when subjects are cued on each trial, they show stronger expectancy effects than when a probable position is held constant for a block, indicating the active nature of the expectancy. Second, while information on spatial position improves performance, information on the form of the stimulus does not. Third, expectancy may lead to improvements in latency without a reduction in accuracy. Fourth, there appears to be little ability to lower the criterion at two positions that are not spatially contiguous. A framework involving the employment of a limited-capacity attentional mechanism seems to capture these constraints better than the more general language of criterion setting. Using this framework, we find that attention shifts are not closely related to the saccadic eye movement system. For luminance detection the retina appears to be equipotential with respect to attention shifts, since costs to unexpected stimuli are similar whether foveal or peripheral. These results appear to provide an important model system for the study of the relationship between attention and the structure of the visual system.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen a surge in accounts motivated by information theory that consider language production to be partially driven by a preference for communicative efficiency. Evidence from discourse production (i.e., production beyond the sentence level) has been argued to suggest that speakers distribute information across discourse so as to hold the conditional per-word entropy associated with each word constant, which would facilitate efficient information transfer (Genzel {\&} Charniak, 2002). This hypothesis implies that the conditional (contextualized) probabilities of linguistic units affect speakers' preferences during production. Here, we extend this work in two ways. First, we explore how preceding cues are integrated into contextualized probabilities, a question which so far has received little to no attention. Specifically, we investigate how a cue's maximal informativity about upcoming words (the cue's effectiveness) decays as a function of the cue's recency. Based on properties of linguistic discourses as well as properties of human memory, we analytically derive a model of cue effectiveness decay and evaluate it against cross-linguistic data from 12 languages. Second, we relate the information theoretic accounts of discourse production to well-established mechanistic (activation-based) accounts: We relate contextualized probability distributions over words to their relative activation in a lexical network given preceding discourse.},

abstract = {How do children acquire humankind's remarkable cognitive skills? Why are the abilities children acquire readily, such as native-language fluency, harder for adults? Although attitudes to these questions span the continuum from nativism to learning theory, answers remain elusive. We relate a recent model of language acquisition in childhood to advances in the neuroscience of adult cognitive control, to propose a domain-general shift in the architecture of learning in childhood. The timing of this supports children's imitative, unsupervised learning of social and linguistic conventions before the maturation of cognitive control gives individuals greater self-direction, which causes learning to become less conventionalized and more idiosyncratic. These changes might represent an important adaptation supporting the development and learning of cultural and linguistic conventions.},

abstract = {A new, information-theoretic model of selectional constraints is proposed. The strategy adopted here is a minimalist one: how far can one get making as few assumptions as possible? In keeping with that strategy, the proposed model consists of only two components: first, a fairly generic taxonomic representation of concepts, and, second, a probabilistic formalization of selectional constraints defined in terms of that taxonomy, computed on the basis of simple, observable frequencies of co-occurrence between predicates and their arguments. Unlike traditional selection restrictions, the information-theoretic approach avoids empirical problems associated with definitional theories of word meaning, accommodates the observation that semantic anomaly often appears to be a matter of degree, and provides an account of how selectional constraints can be learned. A computational implementation of the model "learns" selectional constraints from collections of naturally occurring text; the predictions of the implemented model are evaluated against judgments elicited from adult subjects, and used to explore the way that arguments are syntactically realized for a class of English verbs. The paper concludes with a discussion of the role of selectional constraints in the acquisition of verb meaning.},

abstract = {Three eye movement studies with novel lexicons investigated the role of semantic context in spoken word recognition, contrasting 3 models: restrictive access, access-selection, and continuous integration. Actions directed at novel shapes caused changes in motion (e.g., looming, spinning) or state (e.g., color, texture). Across the experiments, novel names for the actions and the shapes varied in frequency, cohort density, and whether the cohorts referred to actions (Experiment 1) or shapes with action-congruent or action-incongruent affordances (Experiments 2 and 3). Experiment 1 demonstrated effects of frequency and cohort competition from both displayed and non-displayed competitors. In Experiment 2, a biasing context induced an increase in anticipatory eye movements to congruent referents and reduced the probability of looks to incongruent cohorts, without the delay predicted by access-selection models. In Experiment 3, context did not reduce competition from non-displayed incompatible neighbors as predicted by restrictive access models. The authors conclude that the results are most consistent with continuous integration models.},

	- goal: come to agree on the way things are in the world
	- two types of constraints on interlocutor behavior: conventional rules and conversational rules
	- common ground: set of propositions (set of sets of possible worlds where proposition is true) that all interlocutors hold to be true
	- context set: intersection of the common ground
	- two types of linguistic moves: set-up (questions) and payoff (assertions)

abstract = {Many recent models of language comprehension have stressed the role of distributional frequencies in determining the relative accessibility or ease of processing associated with a particular lexical item or sentence structure. However, there exist relatively few comprehensive analyses of structural frequencies, and little consideration has been given to the appropriateness of using any particular set of corpus frequencies in modeling human language. We provide a comprehensive set of structural frequencies for a variety of written and spoken corpora, focusing on structures that have played a critical role in debates on normal psycholinguistics, aphasia, and child language acquisition, and compare our results with those from several recent papers to illustrate the implications and limitations of using corpus data in psycholinguistic research.},

We use regression modeling in conjunction with data from the British National Corpus to measure the amount and specificity of the information available for disambiguation in natural language use. We examine the Direct Object/Sentential Complement ambiguity and the closely related issue of complementizer use in sentential complements, and find that both ambiguity resolution and complementizer use can be predicted from contextual information.},

In Experiment 1, the display included the target word and a competitor with either a lower degree (e.g., bear) or a higher degree (e.g., bean) of phonological overlap with the target. Both competitors had the same degree of orthographic overlap with the target. There were more fixations to the competitors than to unrelated distractors. Crucially, the likelihood of fixating a competitor did not vary as a function of the amount of phonological overlap between target and competitor. In Experiment 2, the display included the target word and a competitor with either a lower degree (e.g., bare) or a higher degree (e.g., bear) of orthographic overlap with the target. Competitors were homophonous and thus had the same degree of phonological overlap with the target. There were more fixations to higher overlap competitors than to lower overlap competitors, beginning during the temporal interval where initial fixations driven by the vowel are expected to occur. The authors conclude that orthographic information is rapidly activated as a spoken word unfolds and is immediately used in mapping spoken words onto potential printed referents.},

abstract = {While much work has been done investigating the role of context in the incremental processing of syntactic indeterminacies, relatively little is known about online semantic interpretation. The experiments in this article made use of the eye-tracking paradigm with spoken language and visual contexts in order to examine how, and when listeners make use of contextually-defined contrast in interpreting simple prenominal adjectives. Experiment 1 focused on intersective adjectives. Experiment 1A provided further evidence that intersective adjectives are processed incrementally. Experiment 1B compared response times to follow instructions such as 'Pick up the blue comb' under conditions where there were two blue objects (e.g. a blue pen and a blue comb), but only one of these objects had a contrasting member in the display. Responses were faster to objects with a contrasting member, establishing that the listeners initially assume a contrastive interpretation for intersective adjectives. Experiments 2 and 3 focused on vague scalar adjectives examining the time course with which listeners establish contrast for scalar adjectives such as tall using information provided by the head noun (e.g. glass) and information provided by the visual context. Use of head-based information was examined by manipulating the typicality of the target object (e.g. whether it was a good or poor example of a tall glass. Use of context-dependent contrast was examined by either having only a single glass in the display (the no contrast condition) or a contrasting object (e.g. a smaller glass). The pattern of results indicated that listeners interpreted the scalar adjective incrementally taking into account context-specific contrast prior to encountering the head. Moreover, the presence of a contrasting object, sharply reduced, and in some conditions completely eliminated, typicality effects. The results suggest a language processing system in which semantic interpretation, as well as syntactic processing, is conducted incrementally, with early integration of contextual information.},

abstract = {Characterizing the relationship between form-based linguistic knowledge and representation of context has long been of importance in the study of on-line language processing. Recent experimental research has shown evidence of very rapid effects of referential context in resolving local indeterminacies on-line. However, there has been no consensus regarding the nature of these context effects. The current paper summarizes recent work covering a range of phenomena for which referential contrast has been shown to influence on-line processing, including prenominal and post-nominal modification, focus operators, and intonational focus. The results of the body of work suggest that referential context effects are not limited to situations in which the linguistic form of the utterance directly specifies the point of contact with context. Rather, context effects of a pragmatic, Gricean nature appear to be possible, suggesting the relationship between linguistic form and context in rapid on-line processing can be of a very indirect nature.},

Classic "poverty of the stimulus" arguments suggest that grammar identification is an intractable inductive problem and that acquisition is possible only because children possess innate knowledge of grammatical structure. An alternative view is emerging from studies of statistical and probabilistic aspects of language, connectionist models, and the learning capacities of infants. This approach emphasizes continuity between how language is acquired and how it is used. It retains the idea that innate capacities constrain language learning, but calls into question whether they include knowledge of grammatical structure.},

abstract = {Recently, it has been shown that visual perception can be radically altered by signals of other modalities. For example, when a single flash is accompanied by multiple auditory beeps, it is often perceived as multiple flashes. This effect is known as the sound-induced flash illusion. In order to investigate the principles underlying this illusion, we developed an ideal observer (derived using Bayes' rule), and compared human judgements with those of the ideal observer for this task. The human observer's performance was highly consistent with that of the ideal observer in all conditions ranging from no interaction, to partial integration, to complete integration, suggesting that the rule used by the nervous system to decide when and how to combine auditory and visual signals is statistically optimal. Our findings show that the sound-induced flash illusion is an epiphenomenon of this general, statistically optimal strategy.},

abstract = {Politeness theory posits that uncertainty quantifiers can be interpreted as hedging strategies and thus be perceived as communicating greater certainty than when they are interpreted as likelihood-communication devices. This has only been tested with verbal probabilities (e.g., it is possible). The present paper aims to test whether numerical probabilities can also be interpreted as face-management devices and to investigate the effect of such an interpretation on risk perception. Four experiments focused on the effect of interpretations of numerical probabilities in negative outcome predictions on risk perception (e.g., there is a 50{\%} probability that your stocks will lose their value). Politeness expectation was manipulated by the personality of the speaker (i.e., blunt vs. tactful, Experiments 1 and 2) and according to the conversational partners' need for politeness (Experiments 3 and 4). Results show that numerical probabilities, like verbal ones, were interpreted as likelihood-communication or face-management devices and that the two interpretations led to different risk perceptions. Findings were replicated with different formats, such as percentage (e.g., 50{\%}) and chance ratio (e.g., 1 chance in 3) and with different degrees of certainty (e.g., .30, .50 and .70). Theoretical and practical implications relevant to risk communication are presented and discussed.},

abstract = {Elicitation of expert opinion is important for risk analysis when only limited data are available. Expert opinion is often elicited in the form of subjective confidence intervals; however, these are prone to substantial overconfidence. We investigated the influence of elicitation question format, in particular the number of steps in the elicitation procedure. In a 3-point elicitation procedure, an expert is asked for a lower limit, upper limit, and best guess, the two limits creating an interval of some assigned confidence level (e.g., 80{\%}). In our 4-step interval elicitation procedure, experts were also asked for a realistic lower limit, upper limit, and best guess, but no confidence level was assigned; the fourth step was to rate their anticipated confidence in the interval produced. In our three studies, experts made interval predictions of rates of infectious diseases (Study 1, n = 21 and Study 2, n = 24: epidemiologists and public health experts), or marine invertebrate populations (Study 3, n = 34: ecologists and biologists). We combined the results from our studies using meta-analysis, which found average overconfidence of 11.9{\%}, 95{\%} CI [3.5, 20.3] (a hit rate of 68.1{\%} for 80{\%} intervals)-a substantial decrease in overconfidence compared with previous studies. Studies 2 and 3 suggest that the 4-step procedure is more likely to reduce overconfidence than the 3-point procedure (Cohen's d = 0.61, [0.04, 1.18]).},

abstract = {We propose a general and predictive explanation of the Wason Selection Task (where subjects are asked to select evidence for testing a conditional "rule"). Our explanation is based on a reanalysis of the task, and on Relevance Theory. We argue that subjects' selections in all true versions of the Selection Task result from the following procedure. Subjects infer from the rule directly testable consequences. They infer them in their order of accessibility, and stop when the resulting interpretation of the rule meets their expectations of relevance. Subjects then select the cards that may test the consequences they have inferred from the rule. Order of accessibility of consequences and expectations of relevance vary with rule and context, and so, therefore, does subjects' performance. By devising appropriate rule-context pairs, we predict that correct performance can be elicited in any conceptual domain. We corroborate this prediction with four experiments. We argue that past results properly reanalyzed confirm our account. We discuss the relevance of the Selection Task to the study of reasoning.},

abstract = {When participants follow spoken instructions to pick up and move objects in a visual workspace, their eye movements to the objects are closely time-locked to referential expressions in the instructions. Two experiments used this methodology to investigate the processing of the temporary ambiguities that arise because spoken language unfolds over time. Experiment 1 examined the processing of sentences with a temporarily ambiguous prepositional phrase (e.g., "Put the apple on the towel in the box") using visual contexts that supported either the normally preferred initial interpretation (the apple should be put on the towel) or the less-preferred interpretation (the apple is already on the towel and should be put in the box). Eye movement patterns clearly established that the initial interpretation of the ambiguous phrase was the one consistent with the context. Experiment 2 replicated these results using prerecorded digitized speech to eliminate any possibility of prosodic differences across conditions or experimenter demand. Overall, the findings are consistent with a broad theoretical framework in which real-time language comprehension immediately takes into account a rich array of relevant nonlinguistic context.},

abstract = {Sentences with temporarily ambiguous reduced relative clauses (e.g., The actress selected by the director believed that...) were preceded by discourse contexts biasing a main clause or a relative clause. Eye movements in the disambiguating region (by the director) revealed that, in the relative clause biasing contexts, ambiguous reduced relatives were no more difficult to process than unambiguous reduced relatives or full (unreduced) relatives. Regression analyses demonstrated that the effects of discourse context at the point of ambiguity (e.g., selected) interacted with the past participle frequency of the ambiguous verb. Reading times were modeled using a constraint-based competition framework in which multiple constraints are immediately integrated during parsing and interpretation. Simulations suggested that this framework reconciles the superficially conflicting results in the literature on referential context effects on syntactic ambiguity resolution.},

In 4 studies involving 954 participants, the authors explored the extent to which measures of cognitive ability and thinking dispositions can predict discrepancies from normative responding on a variety of tasks from the heuristics and biases literature including the selection task, belief bias in syllogistic reasoning, argument evaluation, base-rate use, covariation detection, hypothesis testing, outcome bias, if-only thinking, knowledge calibration, hindsight bias, and the false consensus paradigm. Significant relationships involving cognitive ability were interpreted as indicating algorithmic-level limitations on the computation of the normative response. Relationships with thinking dispositions were interpreted as indicating that styles of epistemic regulation can predict individual differences in performance on these tasks. Although},

The study by Moore and colleagues [Moore, J. W., Wegner, D. M., {\&} Haggard, P. (2009). Modulating the sense of agency with external cues. Conscious and Cognition] aimed to provide further evidence for this view by demonstrating that external agency cues might outweigh or even substitute efferent signals to install a basic registration of self-agency. Although the study contains some critical points that, so we argue, are central to a proper interpretation of the data, it hints at a new perspective on agency: optimal cue integration seems to be the key to a robust sense of agency. We here argue that this framework could allow integrating the findings of Moore and colleagues and other recent agency studies into a comprehensive picture of the sense of agency and its pathological disruptions.},

Experiment 2 finds a corresponding effect on reading times. Experiment 3 finds that making 2 wrong attachments is worse than making 1. Non-self-organizing models require multiple stipulations to predict both kinds of effects. The authors show that, under an appropriately formulated self-organizing account, both results stem from self-reinforcement of node and link activations, a feature that is needed independently.

abstract = {The authors argue that a more complete understanding of how people produce and comprehend language will require investigating real-time spoken-language processing in natural tasks, including those that require goal-oriented unscripted conversation. One promising methodology for such studies is monitoring eye movements as speakers and listeners perform natural tasks. Three lines of research that adopt this approach are reviewed: (i) spoken word recognition in continuous speech, (ii) reference resolution in real-world contexts, and (iii) real-time language processing in interactive conversation. In each domain, results emerge that provide insights which would otherwise be difficult to obtain. These results extend and, in some cases, challenge standard assumptions about language processing.},

We argue that both components are necessary to explain the nature, use and acquisition of human knowledge, and we introduce a theory-based Bayesian framework for modeling inductive learning and reasoning as statistical inferences over structured knowledge representations.},

How do we do it? This review describes recent approaches to reverse-engineering human learning and cognitive development and, in parallel, engineering more humanlike machine learning systems. Computational models that perform probabilistic inference over hierarchies of flexibly structured representations can address some of the deepest questions about the nature and origins of human thought: How does abstract knowledge guide learning and reasoning from sparse data? What forms does our knowledge take, across different domains and tasks? And how is that abstract knowledge itself acquired?},

In the reading studies, syntactic misanalysis effects in sentence complements (e.g., "The student forgot the solution was...") occurred at the verb in the complement (e.g., was) for matrix verbs typically used with noun phrase complements but not for verbs typically used with sentence complements. In addition, a complementizer effect for sentence-complement-biased verbs was not due to syntactic misanalysis but was correlated with how strongly a particular verb prefers to be followed by the complementizer that. The results support models that make immediate use of lexically specific constraints, especially constraint-based models, but are problematic for lexical filtering models.},

abstract = {A substantial amount of recent work in natural language generation has focused on the generation of ''one-shot'' referring expressions whose only aim is to identify a target referent. Dale and Reiter's Incremental Algorithm (IA) is often thought to be the best algorithm for maximizing the similarity to referring expressions produced by people. We test this hypothesis by eliciting referring expressions from human subjects and computing the similarity between the expressions elicited and the ones generated by algorithms. It turns out that the success of the IA depends substantially on the ''preference order'' (PO) employed by the IA, particularly in complex domains. While some POs cause the IA to produce referring expressions that are very similar to expressions produced by human subjects, others cause the IA to perform worse than its main competitors; moreover, it turns out to be difficult to predict the success of a PO on the basis of existing psycholinguistic findings or frequencies in corpora. We also examine the computational complexity of the algorithms in question and argue that there are no compelling reasons for preferring the IA over some of its main competitors on these grounds. We conclude that future research on the generation of referring expressions should explore alternatives to the IA, focusing on algorithms, inspired by the Greedy Algorithm, which do not work with a fixed PO.},

We argue that computational and psycholinguistic approaches to reference production can benefit from closer interaction, and that this is likely to result in the construction of algorithms that differ markedly from the ones currently known in the computational literature. We focus particularly on determinism, the feature of existing algorithms that is perhaps most clearly at odds with psycholinguistic results, discussing how future algorithms might include non-determinism, and how new psycholinguistic experiments could inform the development of such algorithms.},

abstract = {When the brain initiates a saccade, it uses a copy of the oculomotor commands to predict the visual consequences: for example, if one fixates a reach target, a peripheral saccade will produce an internal estimate of the new retinal location of the target, a process called remapping. In natural settings, the target likely remains visible after the saccade. So why should the brain predict the sensory consequence of the saccade when after its completion, the image of the target remains visible? We hypothesized that in the post-saccadic period, the brain integrates target position information from two sources: one based on remapping and another based on the peripheral view of the target. The integration of information from these two sources could produce a less variable target estimate than is possible from either source alone. Here, we show that reaching toward targets that were initially foveated and remapped had significantly less variance than reaches relying on peripheral target information. Furthermore, in a more natural setting where both sources of information were available simultaneously, variance of the reaches was further reduced as predicted by integration. This integration occurred in a statistically optimal manner, as demonstrated by the change in integration weights when we manipulated the uncertainty of the post-saccadic target estimate by varying exposure time. Therefore, the brain predicts the sensory consequences of motor commands because it integrates its prediction with the actual sensory information to produce an estimate of sensory space that is better than possible from either source alone.},

abstract = {Which repair strategy does the language system deploy when it gets garden-pathed, and what can regressive eye movements in reading tell us about reanalysis strategies? Several influential eye-tracking studies on syntactic reanalysis (Frazier {\&} Rayner, 1982; Meseguer, Carreiras, {\&} Clifton, 2002; Mitchell, Shen, Green, {\&} Hodgson, 2008) have addressed this question by examining scanpaths, i.e., sequential patterns of eye fixations. However, in the absence of a suitable method for analyzing scanpaths, these studies relied on simplified dependent measures that are arguably ambiguous and hard to interpret. We address the theoretical question of repair strategy by developing a new method that quantifies scanpath similarity. Our method reveals several distinct fixation strategies associated with reanalysis that went undetected in a previously published data set (Meseguer et al., 2002). One prevalent pattern suggests re-parsing of the sentence, a strategy that has been discussed in the literature (Frazier {\&} Rayner, 1982); however, readers differed tremendously in how they orchestrated the various fixation strategies. Our results suggest that the human parsing system non-deterministically adopts different strategies when confronted with the disambiguating material in garden-path sentences. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

This hypothesis was tested in a large-scale study manipulating reading experiences of adults over several weeks. The group receiving relative clause experience increased reading speeds for object relatives more than for subject relatives, whereas a control experience group did not. The reading time data were compared to performance of a computational model given different amounts of experience.

- code vs inferential model of communication
	1. code: communicator encodes message into signal which is decoded by audience using identical copy of code
	2. inferential: communicator provides evidence of intention to convey certain meaning, which is inferred by audience based on evidence provided
        
- ways in which RT differs from Grice:
	- no need for cooperative principle in RT
	- RT includes computation of explicit, truth-conditional content via pragmatic processes
        
- relevance as property of utterances/thoughts/memories/inferences
        
- search for relevance basic feature of human cognition (cognitive principle of relevance)
        
- build on Grice's meaning{\_}nn: inferential communication not just about affecting thoughts of audience, but doing so by getting them to recognize intention
--{\&}gt; ostensive-inferential communication is just reformulation of grice
        
- assumptions for comprehension process: start with linguistic meaning of sentences (ie propositions at LF) and continue from there until expectations of relevance satisfied 
	--{\&}gt; common element with other gricean theories: there IS such a thing as linguistic meaning, no matter how udnerspecified. what can be learned from the bayesians/distributional people: meaning as distribution over uses
	--{\&}gt; hardcore globalism. No notion of incrementality incorporated. assumes that hearers reason over entire propositions (means you have to wait till you have enough signal to build a proposition). No space for making predictions (both about speaker's intention before end of utterance and about upcoming linguistic input), which I think is one of the number 1 arguments against RT, considering what we know about the brain and that it's always making predictions.
        
- assumption that hearer stops at first interpretation that satisfies expectations of relevance, {\&}quot;because there should never be more than one{\&}quot;
	--{\&}gt; mechanistic view that one interpretation after another is tested for sattisfaction of relevance expectations in order of accessibility. Different from simultaneous integration of evidence {\&}amp; picking the interpretation that has highest posterior probability
        
- further explicit assumption that a rational speaker should formulate utterance so that first interpretation to satisfy hearer's exp of relevance is the intended one
	--{\&}gt; massive audience design assumption
        
- strong vs weak implicatures (essential vs not essential for interpretation)
	--{\&}gt; nice in principle, idea of gradient implicatures. except that they turn it into a binary distinction where one kind of implicature is essential for the interpretation and the others aren't. first of all, it's unclear why you would get weak implicatures anyway, since they're not necessary for the interpretation and you're supposed to derive the best interpretation first. (or actually, you could assume the weak ones are more accessible, so they get computed first but aren't yet enough to satisfy expectation of relevance). second, why the binary distinction instead of saying that some inferences receive more support than others from the utterance and the context?
        
--{\&}gt; FURTHER NOTES:
	- they base their definition of relevance on a tradeoff between positive cognitive effects {\&}amp; processing effort, but they never say what constitutes a positive cog. effect in a particular context, so you can always make up a post hoc story about what the particular effects of an utterance are, and that's why it leads to a particular interpretation
	- interesting example on p. 24: losse uses of language (square faces, silent rooms), which they say pose problem for Grice, because they violate maxim of ttruthfulness. this is a good example of why lexical semantics is futile {\&}amp; it makes more sense to assume not that particular words (like {\&}quot;square{\&}quot;) have inherent meaning, but that in context they are just cues to an intended meaning, with meaning a distribution over previous contexts of use (referential or non-referential). },

People in collectivistic cultures (e.g., China) are said to have interdependent selves, whereas people in individualistic cultures (e.g., the United States) are said to have independent selves. To evaluate the effect of culture, we asked Chinese and American pairs to play a communication game that required perspective taking. Eye-gaze measures demonstrated that the Chinese participants were more tuned into their partner's perspective than were the American participants. Moreover, Americans often completely failed to take the perspective of their partner, whereas Chinese almost never did. We conclude that cultural patterns of interdependence focus attention on the other, causing Chinese to be better perspective takers than Americans. Although members of both cultures are able to distinguish between their perspective and another person's perspective, cultural patterns afford Chinese the effective use of this ability to interpret other people's actions.},

In particular, the analysis aims to overcome shortfalls of previous analyses by, firstly, adopting a multifactorial approach integrating all variables postulated in the literature, thereby doing justice to the well-established fact that cognitive and psychological processes are multivariate and complex. Secondly, the phenomenon is investigated on the basis of a large corpus, rendering the results obtained more representative and valid of naturally occurring language than those of previous studies. To this end, corpus-linguistic operationalizations of phonological, syntactic, semantic and pragmatic determinants of AO are devised and entered into a Linear Discriminant Analysis, which determines the relative influence of all variables (semantic variables being most important) and yields a classification accuracy of 78{\%}. Moreover, by means of the operationalizations developed in this analysis, the ordering of yet unanalyzed adjective strings can be predicted with about equal accuracy (73.5{\%}). © John Benjamins Publishing Company.},

abstract = {The authors present a Bayesian framework for understanding how adults and children learn the meanings of words. The theory explains how learners can generalize meaningfully from just one or a few positive examples of a novel word's referents, by making rational inductive inferences that integrate prior knowledge about plausible word meanings with the statistical structure of the observed examples. The theory addresses shortcomings of the two best known approaches to modeling word learning, based on deductive hypothesis elimination and associative learning. Three experiments with adults and children test the Bayesian account's predictions in the context of learning words for object categories at multiple levels of a taxonomic hierarchy. Results provide strong support for the Bayesian account over competing accounts, in terms of both quantitative model fits and the ability to explain important qualitative phenomena. Several extensions of the basic theory are discussed, illustrating the broader potential for Bayesian models of word learning.},

abstract = {A tendency for speakers to produce short phrases before long phrases has been attributed to the accessibility of short phrases, and thought to reflect universal mechanisms of production. However, recent corpus analyses in Japanese suggest that long phrases tend to be shifted ahead of short ones (Hawkins, J. (1994). A performance theory of order and constituency. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Yamashita, in press). Two on-line experiments confirmed that speakers shifted long arguments to earlier positions more than short arguments, exhibiting a "long before short" preference. We reconcile these contradictory data from English and Japanese by a competition between different factors in an incremental production system.},

abstract = {How do people learn multisensory, or amodal, representations, and what consequences do these representations have for perceptual performance? We address this question by performing a rational analysis of the problem of learning multisensory representations. This analysis makes use of a Bayesian nonparametric model that acquires latent multisensory features that optimally explain the unisensory features arising in individual sensory modalities. The model qualitatively accounts for several important aspects of multisensory perception: (a) it integrates information from multiple sensory sources in such a way that it leads to superior performances in, for example, categorization tasks; (b) its performances suggest that multisensory training leads to better learning than unisensory training, even when testing is conducted in unisensory conditions; (c) its multisensory representations are modality invariant; and (d) it predicts ''missing" sensory representations in modalities when the input to those modalities is absent. Our rational analysis indicates that all of these aspects emerge as part of the optimal solution to the problem of learning to represent complex multisensory environments.},

ON THE ECONOMY OF WORDS
- reminder: any human action will exhibit the PLE
        
- words as tools that are used to convey meanings in order to achieve objectives
        
--{\&}gt; the general analogy is that the sheer haaving of language itself presents an advantage ({\&}quot;general economy{\&}quot;) in achieving one's goals just as for a carpenter jut possessing a particular tool presents an advantage. but then in addition, language/the tool itself should contain an  {\&}quot;internal economy of speech{\&}quot;
        
- more and less economical ways of encoding message in words (or {\&}quot;combining words with meaning{\&}quot;) - both from speaker's and hearer's perspective
	- speaker economy:
		- sepaker's job: select meaning to convey {\&}amp; words to convey them
		-{\&}gt; efficient if vocabulary consists of single word that would mean whatever speaker wanted it to mean (m different meanings), sparing speaker effort required for acquiring {\&}amp; maintaining large vocabulary and retrieving particular words with particular meanings in a given instance (swiss army knife)
	- auditor economy: 
		- hearer's job: decipher speaker's meaning
		-{\&}gt; efficient if vocabulary had different words for each different meaning (m words), sparing hearer effort to attempt to determine meaning of a given word (separate tools for each task)
	-{\&}gt; speaker and auditor economy in opposition, resulting in two opposing forces: Force of Unification (tends to reduce size of vocabulary by unifying meanings behind one word) vs Force of Diversification (tends to increase size of vocabulary so there are different words for different meanings)
        
- the argument: 
1. if we assume explicitly that humans economize effort and
2. analysis of vocabulary balance between two forces is sound
3. then we can test validity of 1. by looking at empirical data (speech) of successful communication:
4. if there's evidence of vocabulary balance in terms of the two forces, then
5. that will provide confirmation of 1. 
-{\&}gt; so 4 is crucial
-{\&}gt; how to test 4:
	- force of Unification will decrease number of different words to 1 while increasing the frequency of that 1 word to 100{\%}. conversely, force of Diversification will act in opposite direction, increasing number of words while decreasing their average frequency. 
	-{\&}gt; prediction: very few very frequent words and verymany very infrequent words (number and frequency as parameters of vocabulary balance)
	-{\&}gt; RANK-FREQUENCY CORRELATION: multiplying a word's rank by its frequency of occurrence (in {\&}quot;Ulysses{\&}quot;), you get a (almost) constant C
        
- on the orderly distribution of meanings (after log-log-plot showing r-f correlation for distribution of words)
	- distribution will be such that on the one hand no single word will have all m different meanings and there will be fewer than m different words
	-{\&}gt; which words have multiple meanings?
	-{\&}gt; how many different meanings do the words of multiple meanings have?
	- m{\_}i * f{\_}i = F{\_}i (m: {\#} of meanings, f: frequency of each meaning, F: total frequency of that word)
		--{\&}gt; i think this is wrong. it assumes that each meaning of a word occurs with equal frequency. shouldn't it rather be sum{\_}m{\_}in{\_}M(f{\_}m,w) = F{\_}w
	- prediction: m=sqrt(F). that is, the number of meanings of a word should be the square root of its total frequency
