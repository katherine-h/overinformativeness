We argue that computational and psycholinguistic approaches to reference production can benefit from closer interaction, and that this is likely to result in the construction of algorithms that differ markedly from the ones currently known in the computational literature. We focus particularly on determinism, the feature of existing algorithms that is perhaps most clearly at odds with psycholinguistic results, discussing how future algorithms might include non-determinism, and how new psycholinguistic experiments could inform the development of such algorithms.},

abstract = {A substantial amount of recent work in natural language generation has focused on the generation of ''one-shot'' referring expressions whose only aim is to identify a target referent. Dale and Reiter's Incremental Algorithm (IA) is often thought to be the best algorithm for maximizing the similarity to referring expressions produced by people. We test this hypothesis by eliciting referring expressions from human subjects and computing the similarity between the expressions elicited and the ones generated by algorithms. It turns out that the success of the IA depends substantially on the ''preference order'' (PO) employed by the IA, particularly in complex domains. While some POs cause the IA to produce referring expressions that are very similar to expressions produced by human subjects, others cause the IA to perform worse than its main competitors; moreover, it turns out to be difficult to predict the success of a PO on the basis of existing psycholinguistic findings or frequencies in corpora. We also examine the computational complexity of the algorithms in question and argue that there are no compelling reasons for preferring the IA over some of its main competitors on these grounds. We conclude that future research on the generation of referring expressions should explore alternatives to the IA, focusing on algorithms, inspired by the Greedy Algorithm, which do not work with a fixed PO.},

abstract = {Speakers often overspecify their target descriptions and include more information than necessary for unique identification of the target referent. In the current paper, we study the production of definite target descriptions, and explore several factors that might influence the amount of information that is included in these descriptions. First, we present the results of a large-scale experiment investigating referential overspecification as a function of the properties of a target referent and the communicative setting. The results show that speakers (both in written and oral conditions) tend to provide more information when a target is plural rather than singular, and in domains where the speaker has more referential possibilities to describe the target. However, written and spoken referring expressions do not differ in terms of semantic redundancy. We conclude our paper by discussing the implications of our empirical findings for pragmatic theory and for language production models. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Characterizing the relationship between form-based linguistic knowledge and representation of context has long been of importance in the study of on-line language processing. Recent experimental research has shown evidence of very rapid effects of referential context in resolving local indeterminacies on-line. However, there has been no consensus regarding the nature of these context effects. The current paper summarizes recent work covering a range of phenomena for which referential contrast has been shown to influence on-line processing, including prenominal and post-nominal modification, focus operators, and intonational focus. The results of the body of work suggest that referential context effects are not limited to situations in which the linguistic form of the utterance directly specifies the point of contact with context. Rather, context effects of a pragmatic, Gricean nature appear to be possible, suggesting the relationship between linguistic form and context in rapid on-line processing can be of a very indirect nature.},

The time devoted to articulating first parts of an utterance is simultaneously used to process further information which is to be incorporated into that utterance. Empirical evidence is presented which supports the assumption that referential noun phrases are indeed often produced incrementally. This assumption explains several phenomena: first, speakers' production of overspecified ('redundant' utterances; second, irregularities concerning the ordering of prenominal adjectives; and third, the way acoustic stress is assigneed in referential noun phrases.},

The results of our three experiments show that speakers are more likely to redundantly include a color attribute when the scene variation is high as compared with when this variation is low (even if this leads to overspecified descriptions).

annote = {- review of research on production of referential expressions (focus on pronouns vs names {\&}amp; relative acoustic prominence). framed as an audience design issue, for which she cites a bunch of support, but also points to limits.

- CHOICES in referring - pronouns vs more {\&}quot;explicit{\&}quot; forms of reference, more or less acoustic prominence
--{\&}gt; (why explicit i don't know)


- what level to make assumptions about addresse knowledge at? specific vs generic addressees

- local vs global assumptions about addressee
- global: shared personal experience, community membership; only to be determined once for a single addressee/situation
- local: what does addressee know/ what is he attending to at each point in discourse. dynamic
--{\&}gt; but can't the global assumptions also be updated dynamically? like when you misremember whether you've told your addressee a particular piece of information and he signals as such with feedback?

- for the rest of paper focuses only on local factors affecting reference production: see paper notes

- centering theory, backward-looking center as most focused. driven by syntactic prominence

- different ways of modeling accessibility of referents in discourse:
- activation of representation (arnold 1998); competition for activation (gradient)
- Centering Theory (grosz et al 1995); relative accessibility based only on grammatical function. does not capture relative differences in activation

- how to ditinguish addressee and speaker-based processes? if speaker's knowledge reflects hearer's knowledge closely enough, you can't tease the two apart

- the Expectancy hypothesis as an explanation for why such diverse factors affect accessibility: they are all correlated with the likelihood of sth being mentioned again. if people use this information, it contributes to ease of comprehension. efficient.

- speaker-oriented vs addressee-oriented view:
- support for speaker-o. view (availability-based production):
- ferreira {\&}amp; dell 2000: speakers place accessible elements early even when this results in local ambiguities

- support for addressee-o. view:

- evidence for AD
- attenuated expressions (pronouns, deaccented forms) used when referent is assumed to be in focus of attention of the hearer (brennan 1995, chafe 1976 2004; gundel et al 1993, prince 1981, geosz{\&}amp; sidner 1986, grosz et al 1995)
- when ref. expression potentially ambiguous, more use of gendered pronouns
- speakers use word pronounciations modulated based on their own and their intelocutor's social identity
- speakers use prosody that disambiguates syntactic structures
- lockridge {\&}amp; brennan, haywood et al 2005
- new yorkers describe landmarks differently when talking to a fellow new yorker than to a visitor (isaacs {\&}amp; clark 1987)
- descriptions of famous people contain more infoermation when referring to people assumed to be less identifiable based on shared communicty membership fussell {\&}amp; krauss 1992)
- the more experience a speaker has with an addressee, the more attenuated ref expressions (previously used) become (tangram study, clark {\&}amp; wilkeds-gibbs 1986)
- people continue to use terms established in conceptual pacts even when that term is too specific/overinformative (brennan {\&}amp; clark 1996), but are more likely to abandon term when talking to new addressee

- evidence against AD
- no systematic avoidance of syntactic ambiguity with word order or {\&}quot;that{\&}quot; omission
- speakers use prosody that disambiguates syntactic structures even when unnecessary
- decisions to mention instruments independent of speaker's beliefs about addressee knowledge
- estimates of referent identifiability often biased in direction of speaker's own knowledge of famous names},

@article{noveck2001,
abstract = {A conversational implicature is an inference that consists of attributing to a speaker an implicit meaning that goes beyond the explicit linguistic meaning of an utterance. This paper experimentally investigates scalar implicature, a paradigmatic case of implicature in which a speaker's use of a term like Some indicates that the speaker had reasons not to use a more informative term from the same scale, e.g. All; thus, Some implicates Not all. Pragmatic theorists like Grice would predict that a pragmatic interpretation is determined only after its explicit, logical meaning is incorporated (e.g. where Some means at least one). The present work aims to developmentally examine this prediction by showing how younger, albeit competent, reasoners initially treat a relatively weak term logically before becoming aware of its pragmatic potential. Three experiments are presented. Experiment 1 presents a modal reasoning scenario offering an exhaustive set of conclusions; critical among these is participants' evaluation of a statement expressing Might be x when the context indicates that the stronger Must be x is true. The conversationally-infelicitous Might be x can be understood logically (e.g. as compatible with Must) or pragmatically (as exclusive to Must). Results from 5-, 7-, and 9-year-olds as well as adults revealed that (a) 7-year-olds are the youngest to demonstrate modal competence overall and that (b) 7- and 9-year-olds treat the infelicitous Might logically significantly more often than adults do. Experiment 2 showed how training with the modal task can suspend the implicatures for adults. Experiment 3 provides converging evidence of the developmental pragmatic effect with the French existential quantifier Certains (Some). While linguistically-sophisticated children (8- and 10-year-olds olds) typically treat Certains as compatible with Tous (All), adults are equivocal. These results, which are consistent with unanticipated findings in classic developmental papers, reveal a consistent ordering in which representations of weak scalar terms tend to be treated logically by young competent participants and more pragmatically by older ones. This work is also relevant to the treatment of scalar implicatures in the reasoning literature.},

Ahistorical accounts appeal only to the informativeness and availability of terms and to the current salience of the object's features. Historical accounts appeal in addition to the recency and frequency of past references and to partner-specific conceptualizations of the object that people achieve interactively. Evidence from 3 experiments favors a historical account and suggests that when speakers refer to an object, they are proposing a conceptualization of it, a proposal their addresses may or may not agree to. Once they do establish a shared conceptualization, a conceptual pact, they appeal to it in later references even when they could use simpler references. Over time, speakers simplify conceptual pacts and, when necessary, abandon them for new conceptualizations.},
