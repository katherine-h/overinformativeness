# Overinformativeness
## Notes and ideas from the papers by Judith

## ToDo

**Judith:** 

1. put study on mturk

2. initial pre-processing of speaker data to create columns of color/size mention for each message

**Caroline:**

1. Check automatic message annotation.

2. Add extra columns for type of modification (pre-postnominal).

...then we reconvene and make pretty plots of analyses listed below...

## Analyses

### Listener (sanity checks)

These analyses will just serve as a way for us to identify possibly problematic pairs of subjects.

1. Proportion of target vs other choices on filler trials.

2. Proportion of target vs other choices on target trials (split up by condition).

3. Proportion of trials on which listeners send a message at all. 

4. More fuzzy: when messages are sent, what are they for? Requests for clarification, standard backchannels ("OK"), etc. --> will require some manual looking into the data.


### Speaker (the real interesting stuff!)

These are the analyses of interest.

1. Proportion of color mention on color-only, size-only, and color-or-size trials.

2. Proportion of size mention on color-only, size-only, and color-or-size trials.

3. Proportion of color-and-size mention on color-only, size-only, and color-or-size trials.

4. Minor sanity check, testing for individual variation in baseline willingness to overmodify: Proportion of color/size mention on filler trials.

Pre-processing to get 1 - 4:

1. Annotate each message for whether it includes a (the correct) color, a (the correct) size, type.

2. For each message, if there was a color modifier, did it occur pre- or post-nominally?

3. For each message, if there was a size modifier, did it occur pre- or post-nominally?

4. Less pressing: If more than one message is sent, what is it for?
