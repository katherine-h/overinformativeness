# Preliminary results 

We use the model in overinformativeness.church to generate predictions for the situation in which there is a big red object, a small red object, and a small yellow object (where objects don't differ in type). This replicates the situations described in Gatt, van Gomple, Krahmer, and van Deemter (2011, CogSci). Model predictions for optimal parameters (eye-balling) are shown alongside the empirical data for both Dutch and English from the paper. Graphs with a fuller exploration of the parameter space are in /graphs.
