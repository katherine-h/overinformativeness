## Idea

- What we want to find out: Are the typicality values fix in our semantic knowledge, or are they constantly updated by our world knowledge? Therefore, does an exposure of a new frequency of an object’s color influence how we produce overinformative expressions?
- If typicality values are taken from world knowledge, we have 0 and 1 valued semantics that are then multiplied with knowledge from the real world. If the typicality is in the semantics, we already have truth conditional values between 0 and 1. (Important when thinking about how to construct the model.)

## Experimental set-up

- Story
    - Daxi (Alien): Can you help me sort my food?
- 6 different items each in 2 colors, 3 conditions
    - item (typical color, atypical color): banana (yellow, blue), apple (red, yellow), strawberry (red, brown), onion (greyish, green), carrot (orange, blue), cucumber (green, orange)
    - 3 prevalence/frequency conditions: low - target color only in very few instances, middle - target color in 50% of the instances, high - target color in almost every instance
    -—>  6 different combinations per item
- Sorting: sort food in labeled bins (= Exposure)
- Now Daxi wants to put them in his cupboard, exactly the way they used to be. Luckily, Daxi had the order of the things in his book/picture, but when he is on the letter, he can’t look at it. Would you help Daxi? “I want to start with the things that are high up in the cupboard, so please start with the highest item. So, what is the item for the highest drawer?” (= Production)

in exposure, sweets should always be the last thing to sort into buckets because looking at them closely is not so important
Question: Do typicality measure and production on one subject or separately? If together, which one first?

6 items in 2 - 3 colors

in production study

- 4 targets for each item (typical color overinformatively, atypical color overinformatively, typical color only informatively, atypical color only informatively) —> 24 targets in total
- either free production or showing alternative answers and most fitting needs to be chosen

in distribution/ typicality study

- ideas:
    - normal typicality measurement (as seen before)
    - show (or just sketch (no shades)) b/w food item and ask which color this most probably has
    - show (or just sketch (no shades)) b/w food item and have a slider that goes from yellow to blue banana: where to position the slider between the two according two likelihood of the color

Thoughts on contexts:

- instead of making targets such as
    - banana yellow (target), x, y
    - banana yellow (target), banana blue, y
    - banana blue (target), x, y
    - banana blue (target), banana yellow, y
—> have color being informatively/overinformatively
- one could also do
    - banana yellow (target), x, y
    - banana yellow (target), something else being yellow, y
    - banana blue (target), x, y
    - banana blue (target), something else being blue, y
—> have color being useful/useless
