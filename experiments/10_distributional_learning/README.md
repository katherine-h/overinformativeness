## Idea

- What we want to find out: Are the typicality values fix in our semantic knowledge, or are they constantly updated by our world knowledge? Therefore, does an exposure of a new frequency of an object’s color influence how we produce overinformative expressions?
- If typicality values are taken from world knowledge, we have 0 and 1 valued semantics that are then multiplied with knowledge from the real world. If the typicality is in the semantics, we already have truth conditional values between 0 and 1. (Important when thinking about how to construct the model.)

## General experimental set-up

- Story
    - Daxi (Alien): Can you help me sort my food?
- 6 different items each in 2 colors, 2 (maybe 3) conditions
    - Item (typical color, atypical color): banana (yellow, blue), apple (red, blue), pear (orange, green), carrot (orange, pink), tomato (red, pink), orange (orange, green) (for Exp 10,12,14,15)
    - 3 prevalence/frequency conditions: low - atypical color no (in current study [update 10/07/2016])/ only in very few instances, middle - atypical color in 50% of the instances, high - atypical color in (almost) every instance
    -—>  6 different combinations per item

## Exposure

- Sorting: sort food in labeled bins
- Maybe always have sweets as the last thing to be sorted into buckets because looking at them closely is not so important

Question: Make typicality measure and production on one subject or separately? If together, which one first?

## Production

- 4 targets for each item (typical color overinformatively, atypical color overinformatively, typical color only informatively, atypical color only informatively) —> 24 targets in total
- Either free production or showing alternative answers and most fitting needs to be chosen

## Distribution/ Typicality measurement

- Ideas:
    - Normal typicality measurement (as seen before; chosen in current study [update 10/07/2016])
    - Show (or just sketch (no shades)) b/w food item and ask which color this most probably has
    - Show (or just sketch (no shades)) b/w food item and have a slider that goes from yellow to blue banana: where to position the slider between the two according two likelihood of the color

## Thoughts on contexts

- In current study: Instead of making targets such as
    - Banana yellow (target), x, y
    - Banana yellow (target), banana blue, y
    - Banana blue (target), x, y
    - Banana blue (target), banana yellow, y
—> Have color being informatively/overinformatively
- One could also do
    - Banana yellow (target), x, y
    - Banana yellow (target), something else being yellow, y
    - Banana blue (target), x, y
    - Banana blue (target), something else being blue, y
—> Have color being useful/useless

## Thoughts on getting clearer typicality/ distribution data

- Maybe change order of typicality/ distribution rating and production to get purer results in typicality/ distribution measurements
- Maybe insert summary slide between exposure and next slide to show distribution of colored fruits in basket again

## Exp 11

- Included blocks: Typicality (How typical is this color for this object? - no alien reference at all)
- Participants: 30?
- Aim: 
    - Find a general typicality norm for chosen items (with usual world knowlwedge and no mention of an artificial world)
- Results:
    - Typicality:  <br />  
        <img src="../11_color_norming/results/graphs/png/typicalities.png" width="400"/>
        - Items with biggest typicality difference: apple (blue, red), banana (blue, yellow), carrot (purple, orange), tomato (pink, red)
        - Items with good mid-typicality values: pepper (orange, red), orange (green, orange), avocado (black, green), tomato (green, red)
        - Red avocado wasn't as atypically perceived as expected; Brown banana was more atypical than expected; Pink and purple carrot are very atypical even though they exist
- Problems:
    - Unclear whether orange was always perceived as an orange (could be lime, plum)


## Exp 10

- Included blocks: Exposure, Production, Typicality (How typical is this color for this object on Daxy's planet) 
- Participants: 15
- Aim:
    - Show possible problems with the set-up
    - Compare typicality values to former study: Do people adapt? Do they disregard their normal world knowledge completely when evaluating Daxy's planet?
    - Can a certain exposure of an object in a certain color influence the speech production in a reference game? (might an alien "listening" make a difference to a human being listening?)
- Results:
    - Production:  <br />  
        <img src="results/graphs/png/distribution_effect_production.png" width="300"/>
        - If the color is needed for an unambiguous reference (informative (red) condition), the use of color adjectives stays approximately stable along different exposure phases, i.e., the color is mentioned
        - If the atypical color is not needed to name for an unambiguous reference (overinformative (blue) condition), the use of the color adjective decreases slightly with increased exposure --> we can make the atypical color more typical (used less overinformatively) --> great!
        - If the typical color is not needed to name for an unambiguous reference (overinformative (blue) condition), the use of the color adjective increases slightly with increased exposure --> weird!?
    - Typicality:  <br />  
        <img src="results/graphs/png/meantypicality.png" width="300"/>
        <img src="results/graphs/png/meantypicality_byitem.png" width="300"/>
        - The rated typicality shows the expected upward shift (typicality increases with increased exposure) 
        - Comparing atypical color with typical color with same exposure: Participants constantly rate normally typical color higher than normally atypical color, even though when we just look at the evidence from Daxy's planet, they should be the same --> special case: pear
        - In former study, pear was item with most acceptable color in atypical case; it is the only one here, where in one condition (no instance of (a)typical color was shown in exposure), the atypical color was rated approximately with the same typicality as the typical one (and even higher)
- Problems:
    - Production: Typical color in different exposures behaves weirdly. If participant wasn't exposed to typical color, he used it less overinformatively than when exposed to it a lot.
    - Typicality: Apple behaves weird, which can be connected to fact, that sometimes there is only just one data point for a certain value --> general problem: amount of data



## Exp 12

- Included blocks: Production, Typicality (How typical is this color for this object (for you)?)
- Participants: 15
- Aim:
    - Trying to get a baseline, what people do, when not actively exposed with fruit items in different colors
    - Does the typicality measure differ from the one in Exp 11 (original norming study)
- Results:
    - Production:  <br />  
        <img src="../12_production_calibration/results/graphs/png/distribution_effect_production.png" width="300"/>
        - Atypical colors are mentioned more often than typical colors (what other studies also have shown), but we have a very high rate; possible reason: people didn't know that Daxy understands fruit names and therefore tried to avoid them 
    - Typicality:  <br />  
        <img src="../12_production_calibration/results/graphs/png/meantypicality_byitem.png" width="300"/>
        - Almost exact replica of original color norming data (Exp 11)
- Problems:
	- People were unsure whether Daxy knew the words for fruit items
    - --> they used color adjectives a lot to avoid naming the fruit 
    - --> overinformativeness values are "useless"


## Exp 14

- Included blocks: Production, Typicality (How typical is this color for this object on Daxy's planet)
- Participants: 15
- Aim:
	- How does the typicality measurement change, when not asking "for you", but "on Daxy's planet"  
- Results:
    - Production:  <br />  
        <img src="../14_production_calibration_dtyp/results/graphs/png/distribution_effect_production.png" width="300"/>
        - Same problem as in Exp 12
    - Typicality:  <br />  
        <img src="../14_production_calibration_dtyp/results/graphs/png/meantypicality_byitem.png" width="300"/>
        - Even though there was no exposure, participants noticed that for the meal preparation, there were as much atypically colored fruits as typically colored fruits; this can be seen in the rating as atypically and typically colored fruits are rated equally being at ca 6 in the typicality measurement
- Problems:
    - People were unsure whether Daxy knew the words for fruit items
    - --> they used color adjectives a lot to avoid naming the fruit 
    - --> overinformativeness values are "useless"


## Exp 15

- Included blocks: Production, Typicality (How typical is this color for this object on Daxy's planet)
- Participants: 15
- Aim:
	- With clarified instructions, that Daxy understands fruit names, look ate production and usage of overinformative expressions 
- Comments: 
    - Difference to 14: Tell participants explicitely that Daxy understands fruit types
- No results yet
